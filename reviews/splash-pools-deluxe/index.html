  <h1>Splash Pools Round/Oval Deluxe Pool Package Review</h1>
  <p class="introText">There are two main categories for above ground pools - the first is a pool that&#8217;s cost effective, portable, and designed to be easy to relocate. The second type of pool is more sturdy, premium, and created to be a permanent extension of the house. The Round Deluxe Pool Package, by Splash Pools, is definitely the second type. This pool is extremely well made, has a high-quality design and appearance, and is the perfect fit for larger yards or big families. In short, if you want an all encompassing above ground pool system, and want to invest in a product that your family can use for years, the Round Deluxe may just be the perfect pool for you.</p>
  <p>Read our detailed thoughts on the Splash Pools Deluxe Package below.</p>
  <h2>Pool Sizes</h2>
  <p>The Deluxe comes in two different shapes and four different sizes. These are large pools, and are most likely designed for families that want to build a deck around them or make them the center piece of their backyard.</p>
  <p>Depending on which model you choose, you will either get a traditional above ground pool shape - which is a round circle, or you&#8217;ll get an oval design, that&#8217;s much more like an inground pool, but with curved edges. The sizes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Round - 18ft by 52 inches high
    </li>
    <li>
      Round - 24ft by 52 inches high
    </li>
    <li>
      Oval - 30ft by 15ft and 52 inches high
    </li>
    <li>
      Oval - 45ft by 18ft and 52 inches high
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even the smallest pool, the Round Deluxe that measures 18ft in diameter and 52 inches high, is very nicely sized. Most families won&#8217;t ever need a pool larger than this. It&#8217;s a perfect amount of room for large groups of people and mid-sized pool parties, and won&#8217;t take up too much space in your yard.</p>
  <p>However, the 24ft Round Deluxe Package is truly massive. It should be big enough for even the largest pool parties, but this also means it will take up much more space in your yard. If you&#8217;ve got the room though, a big pool is always the most fun. This would also be a great pool to build a deck around.</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;re interested in something that&#8217;s more like a conventional inground pool, the Oval Deluxe Packages from Splash Pools are a great option. The smaller size, at 30ft by 15ft, is a great pool, and should fit in most yards. If you are considering a pool like this, adding a deck is a perfect choice, as a flat deck can sit alongside the square pool quite nicely.</p>
  <p>For buyers that truly want the biggest pool they can get, the 45ft by 18ft Oval Deluxe is just about the largest above ground pool you can get your hands on at this price point. Families that want or need an incredibly large pool, something similar in size to a large inground pool, will love this option, but it will be too big for many families. However, in our experience, as long as you have the yard space, buying a really large pool doesn&#8217;t have much of a downside, as long as you&#8217;re comfortable spending more money.</p>
  <h2>Quality</h2>
  <p>Splash Pools know how to make a high-quality pool, and their Deluxe Packages have a strong mix of good looks and solid materials. The steel frame, in particular, is very strong, with a 7-inch galvanized steel ledge that sits on top of the pool wall and provides extra support to the frame.</p>
  <p>The resin ladder that comes in any package is another highlight, and it&#8217;s one of the better pool ladders we&#8217;ve seen to come in a pool package. While you can certainly purchase a better ladder separately (see our pool ladder buying guide for our thoughts on picking the best pool ladder), you won&#8217;t need to spend any additional money if you purchase a Deluxe pool - you will have everything you need.</p>
  <h2>What&#8217;s Included</h2>
  <p>No matter which Deluxe Package you buy, you&#8217;ll have all the tools you need to get setup and running. The packages always include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Steel frame with 7-inch steel ledge
    </li>
    <li>
      Resin ladder that can be raised and lowered on the outside of the pool
    </li>
    <li>
      Vinyl pool liner
    </li>
    <li>
      1hp pump
    </li>
    <li>
      Skimmer
    </li>
    <li>
      Installation video
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of the materials here are good quality, with the pool pump being everything you need to keep your pool clean and running for years. However, we&#8217;d also recommend looking into pool cleaning supplies to pick up along with whatever pool you choose. A good set of cleaning materials will help you prolong the life of your liner, and keep your pool fresh and clean.</p>
  <p>Speaking of the liner, it&#8217;s also good quality vinyl, but some buyers may want to swap out the liner for something of higher quality or to try a different look. If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about the different types of pool liners, and how to pick the best one for your pool, check out <a href="/guides/liner-guide/">our liner guide</a>.</p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>This is one area where the Splash Pools Deluxe Packages fall a little short of the competition. The pools aren&#8217;t particularly difficult to set up, but they are standard above ground pools, so it will take at least an afternoon or two until you have the pool set up and running properly. Compared to other companies that offer more portable solutions, like Intex, Splash Pools are designed to be more permanent, and will take longer to set up. But with that extra time, rest assured that you are building a pool that will extremely durable, and was made to withstand years of abuse, and all different types of weather - although we&#8217;d recommend buying a quality pool cover if you see especially cold weather or snow during the winter.</p>
  <p>Splash Pool includes a handy setup DVD to help you plan out your pool. The first step, with any above ground pool, is to measure out the space that you&#8217;re going to use. This may seem obvious, but many people don&#8217;t spend much time setting up the ground properly, and this can negatively affect the life of your pool. Once you&#8217;ve measured where you want the pool to go, spend some time evening out the ground. Make the area as flat as you possibly can, since any bumps can create pressure in your liner. Over time, this will wear out the liner and can lead to early tearing in the bottom of your pool. By properly preparing the ground, you are ensuring that the life of your liner is maximized.</p>
  <p>After this, it&#8217;s time to build the frame and set up the walls. This is the most daunting step, as it requires tools and is very difficult to do by yourself. We highly recommend building the frame with at least one other person, as it will help you catch any mistakes and make the time go by much faster. Once the frame is built, you&#8217;ll need to stretch out the liner and attach the pool pump, both of which are straightforward - the included DVD will help you through the process.</p>
  <p>The last step is to fill the pool with water. You don&#8217;t have to stand around and wait while the pool fills, but we&#8217;d really recommend that you spend some time checking the liner and frame while the pool fills with water. Any mistakes made during the frame construction, or accidental tears in the liner, will be easy to catch and fix at this stage - at least, much easier than they will be when your pool is filled with over a thousand gallons of water.</p>
  <h2>Buying Options</h2>
  <p>For the best prices, and the most secure shipping services, we recommend purchasing your pool from a large online retailer, like Amazon or Home Depot. They each have thousands of warehouses, and have large departments dedicated to customer service. They also have great return policies, and the buying experience online is very good.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Splash Pools has determined what type of pool they want to make, and knocked it out of the park. No matter what type of Deluxe Package you purchase, you will get a great pool, at a good price, and it will last you for many years. The included 35-year warranty speaks to Splash Pools&#8217; confidence in their product. These are large pools intended to be set up in your backyard and kept there for many years, so if this is something that you want, check out the reviews on Amazon for Splash Pools Deluxe.</p>
  <h2>Other Options</h2>
  <p>If you like the Deluxe Packages by Splash Pools, but aren&#8217;t sure that it&#8217;s the best choice for you, we have some other recommendations you might like. We&#8217;ve mentioned the Intex line of products a few times - we&#8217;re big fans of their simple, straightforward setup and the extremely good value for money. If you want a mid-sized pool with good extras, and don&#8217;t want to spend a lot of money, we&#8217;d highly recommend checking out the <a href="/reviews/intex-metal-frame/">Intex Metal Frame pools</a>.</p>
  <p>You may also want to do some research on the <a href="/reviews/heritage-ta/">Heritage TA pool</a> systems. They are similarly priced to the Deluxe Package pools, but include some nice extra features, and have a clean design that some buyers find more attractive.</p>
