  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Before you start researching which type of above ground pool to buy, it's important to answer a few questions about your needs for a pool. Here's what we'd recommend asking yourself and your loved ones before seriously considering any pool:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      How much can I afford to spend? Sure, the price of a pool is important, and will generally determine the quality of the pool that you get. However, some very affordable pools will provide great value. The important thing with the price is your overall enjoyment - if you buy something that's even a bit out of your price range, even if you think it's going to be a better deal in the long run, you may very well enjoy it less because of the higher than expected costs. It's also important to consider the operating budget of a pool and everything you need to keep it clean and running properly. So make sure you've set aside a complete budget for the pool, and go based on that decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      How big of a pool do you need? If you have a large family, or plan to throw lots of pool parties, you're going to need a larger pool. A small 10ft round pool just won't be enough for more than a few people. However, if you've got small children, or only plan to have a couple of people over to spend time in the pool occassionally, there's really not much need for a massive 24ft pool. The other thing to consider is the size of your yard, if you've got a larger backyard, then you can pretty much do whatever you want. But if you're short on space, you may need to consider a smaller pool, or a pool that can be easily stored if you need more space in the backyard for certain events.
    </li>
    <li>
      What's the climate in your area like? This may seem like a trivial factor, but if you live in a cold area of the world, then it's likely that you're going to want to store or cover your pool during the winter months. This can drastically alter which type of pool you purchase. For instance, if you don't need a large pool, but live in an area where it snows a lot, then you may want to consider buying a portable pool that you can quickly drain and move. On the other hand, if you want to purchase a larger pool, and would like to use it as much as possible even during cold weather, purchasing a pump that also heats the water may be a great investment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, how much maintenance can you handle? Many pools come in sets, which means they have everything you need to get started. But you'll still need to make sure the water is properly chlorinated and cleaned. This also means the pump needs to continually move water throughout your pool, which costs electricity. Automatic vacuums can help reduce maintenance, but will cost your money. The bottom line here is that if you're okay with doing some maintenance, you can get by with purchasing a pool set. However, if you'd like to do as little work yourself as possible, you can purchase some more options and extra devices that will help reduce the amount of work you need to do to keep the pool running.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Our Thoughts On The Best Above Ground Pools in 2017</h2>
  <h3>Splash Pools</h3>
  <p>
    Splash pools is a great pool for buyers that want a large, traditionally shaped pool with most of the items you'll need to get the pool up and running. At $2,000, it's a fairly priced pool, considering that it's quite big.
  </p>
  <h3>Embassy Pool</h3>
  <p>
    The Embassy Pool isn't as popular as many of our other picks, but it is a fantastic product, with plenty of great reviews. The materials included in the package are great, and the included extras are all good quality. This is a great option, and the price is competitive with other large, well-built pools

  <h3>Heritage TA Pool</h3>
  <p>
    The Heritage TA system is a great pool, and while it's on the expensive side, you'll have everything you need to get started, and be happy with your purchase for years to come.

  <h3>Bestway Steep Pro Pool</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike just about every other product in this list, the Bestway Steep Pro is a bare-bones product, with just a basic pool setup. You will have to purchase the pump, ladder, and any additional extras yourself. But this is a fantastic pool that will last you years and years. We recommend the Bestway to pool buyers that want to choose their own extras upfront. If that's you, then the Bestway offers one of the best products on the market.

  <h3>Intex Metal Frame Pool</h3>
  <p>

  <p>
    Intex pools are wonderfully made, with a simple setup and easy maintenance. They also typically carry a light price tag, and this is definitely the case with the Easy Set Pool.

  <h3>Fitmax iPool</h3>
  <p>
    The Fitmax iPool is one of the more unique options on our list. It's a pool that was built for exercise, and depending on the model you choose, it can actually be quite small. But with the one-of-a-kind frame and harness system, you can set up and swim as long as you'd like. If your primary use for a pool is fitness, you can't do much better than the iPool.

    The Blue Wave Belize is a premium product, and while it's on the expensive side, you've got everything you need to get set up and going. The Belize is a perfect product for potential buyers that want to purchase one item and get a great pump, liner, and plenty of other top-notch accessories.
