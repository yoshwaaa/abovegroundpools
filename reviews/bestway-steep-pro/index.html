  <h1>Bestway Steep Pro Above Ground Pool Review</h1>
  <p class="introText">The Bestway Steep Pro is a perfect option for buyers that are looking for a mid-sized pool with great build quality, but don&#8217;t necessarily need all the extras included with most other above ground pool systems. The Steep Pro has a simple, yet sturdy, frame that&#8217;s easy to set up and has plenty of other solid features that make it a great buy at its price point.</p>
  <h2>Pool Sizes</h2>
  <p>The Steep Pro comes in 3 different sizes and price points. The difference between price is quite small (less than $100), so we&#8217;d recommend basing your size decision off of your needs and the size of your yard. The sizes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      10 feet wide and 30 inches tall
    </li>
    <li>
      14 feet wide and 48 inches tall
    </li>
    <li>
      15 feet wide and 48 inches tall
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The 10-foot pool is best for children or smaller families that don&#8217;t need a deep pool. However, at only around $100, it&#8217;s a great deal for those that want a quality pool, just at a smaller size.</p>
  <p>However, we&#8217;d recommend getting one of the two larger pools. Either size should be perfect for most buyers. Even the 14-foot pool will be large enough for most families, and is still more than capable of larger pool parties. </p>
  <p>No matter which pool you buy, the quality of the materials is the same, which is to say it&#8217;s very good, especially considering the price point of all these pools. We&#8217;d recommend the 15-foot pool, just to get the most size, but if your yard is extremely small, or you only have a certain amount of room, rest assured that any variations of the Bestway Steep Pro are a great value.</p>
  <h2>Build Quality</h2>
  <p>We&#8217;ve mentioned it before, and we&#8217;ll say it again - for the price, it&#8217;s hard to do better than the Steep Pro. The frame is solid and made of steel, which is standard for above ground pools, but the quality is certainly high. The walls are made from 3-ply PVC, and everything else included in with the Steep Pro is of great quality.</p>
  <h2>What&#8217;s Included</h2>
  <p>Compared to a lot of other above ground pool sets, the Steep Pro may seem a little stark. It&#8217;s got all the essentials to get a pool set up, but you&#8217;ll also need a pump and ladder, and may want to include a pool cover, especially if you plan to put the pool under a tree, or need to cover it during the winter.</p>
  <p>The Steep Pro includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Steel frame
    </li>
    <li>
      PVC band (the wall that surrounds the pool)
    </li>
    <li>
      A flow control valve for draining
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The pool has everything you need to set the pool up and fill it with water, but you definitely won&#8217;t want to do that without a pump. One of the best features of the Steep Pro is the valve control. If you plan to drain the pool regularly for storage during the winter, or just enjoy having more control over the flow of water, the drain system in the pool will allow you to reduce or increase how much water is being drained from the pool at any given time. While it may sound trivial, this can help you ensure that draining water doesn&#8217;t damage your yard.</p>
  <p>When purchasing the pool, you&#8217;ll need a quality pump as well. You can check out our suggestions for above ground pool pumps here.</p>
  <h2>Installation and Maintenance</h2>
  <p>One of the best features of the Steep Pro is the installation. It&#8217;s incredibly easy, even in comparison to other straightforward above ground pool setups, like the Intex line of products. You won&#8217;t need a bunch of other tools, and the estimated setup time, not including the time it takes to fill the pool with water, should only take about an hour or so.</p>
  <p>Maintenance is also incredibly easy, since the pool materials are very high quality. One important thing to remember is, when setting up the pool, you&#8217;ll need to properly prepare the ground before you begin placing the frame. Any dips or bumps in the ground can place pressure on the pool lining, and can drastically reduce the life of your pool. This is an important step that&#8217;s often overlooked.</p>
  <h2>Buying Options</h2>
  <p>If you decide to purchase a pool online, we&#8217;d highly recommend purchasing from one of the larger, more reputable online retailers, like Amazon or Home Depot. These companies not only provide the best quality assurance and customer services, but they often have the best prices, especially when compared to local pool dealers.</p>
  <p>However, we also understand that many buyers would prefer to purchase their pool from a local dealer that can help them with setup and will be around to answer questions or deal with concerns. If you do have a local pool dealer that you trust, this can be a great option.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Bestway Steep Pro is a great pool. While it doesn&#8217;t include absolutely everything you need to get started, it does provide a fantastic value, and the quality of the pool is top notch. Just remember that, if you do purchase the pool, you&#8217;ll need to buy a pump and a ladder, but our buying guides will help you make the right decision.</p>
  <p>The Steep Pro would a great pool for most families, and because it doesn&#8217;t include a pump, you&#8217;re free to make your choice based off of your individual needs. For instance, if you&#8217;d like a basic pump, you won&#8217;t need to spend much to get a good quality product. Or, if you want a more powerful pump with extra features, like heating or a pool light, you can purchase one of those as well. This makes the Steep Pro one of the best all around pools for buyers that want to customize their product.</p>
  <p>If you like the Steep Pro, but are interested in some other products, we&#8217;d also recommend anything in the Intex line. They are similar in price, but also include a pump and ladder, and have a very good build quality. However, for the money, they tend to be a bit smaller. If you want a pool that&#8217;s similar in size to the Steep Pro, you&#8217;ll have to pay more - but the Intex pools come with pumps and ladders.</p>
