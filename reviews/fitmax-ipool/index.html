  <h1>Fitmax iPool Review</h1>
  <p class="introText">A truly unique above ground pool, the Fitmax iPool is built around one idea - swimming is one of the best exercises for your body. The iPool was made to try and provide swimmers with a comfortable, easy to install, and compact swimming pool system. But how does it compare to a full sized pool at the gym for exercise? Read our thoughts below.</p>
  <h2>Pool Size</h2>
  <p>The iPool is much smaller than your standard above ground pool (at least, compared to most of the other pools we review). It&#8217;s a 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall, and just about 3 feet deep. This may seem like a small pool, and it really is. However, the iPool was never intended to be a full sized swimming pool. There are plenty of great options for families that need a good above ground pool, but the iPool is focused on exercise.</p>
  <p>That being said, you won&#8217;t find much of an excuse to do anything other than exercise in this pool. It&#8217;s just too small. At just 3 feet deep, the iPool doesn&#8217;t give you much room to wade around without taking nearly half your body out of the water. However, if you want to use the iPool as it was intended, which is as a piece of exercise equipment, it doesn&#8217;t get much better than this. The iPool is compact and portable, which means you can set it up in a corner of the yard, or even on a deck, without much trouble. The size is perfect for any single swimmer, but won&#8217;t fit anyone users hoping to have their friend or family member join them for exercise. Again, it&#8217;s meant for a single swimmer focused on exercise.</p>
  <h2>Build Quality &amp; Warranty</h2>
  <p>The frame of the Fitmax iPool is solid steel, and it&#8217;s in a traditional square shape, instead of the rounded shape most above ground pools adopt. The water capacity is rated at 1,000 gallons, which the included water pump can adeptly manage. The steel frame is also coated with zinc, which fights against rust and the liner is very sturdy. This is a pool that&#8217;s meant to be used and abused, and it shows in the quality of the materials.</p>
  <p>Fitmax offers a standard 5-year warranty on the iPool, which is a little less than a lot of larger family above ground pools, but considering the outstanding materials, most users don&#8217;t seem to have many problems with their iPool. It&#8217;s important to keep up with maintenance, like with any other pool, but the size and materials make this a pretty easy task for most buyers.</p>
  <h2>What&#8217;s Included</h2>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, the iPool comes with a zinc coated steel frame, and a vinyl and polyester liner to cover the sides and floor of the pool. A stainless steel ladder is also included, which is lockable. A pool pump, rated for up to 1000 gallons per hour, is included, as is a basic repair kit and cover.</p>
  <p>The entire iPool set comes with the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Steel Frame
    </li>
    <li>
      Liner
    </li>
    <li>
      Stainless Steel Ladder
    </li>
    <li>
      1000gph Filter Water Pump
    </li>
    <li>
      Floor Sheet
    </li>
    <li>
      Repair Kit
    </li>
    <li>
      Vinyl Cover
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>One of the main features of the iPool is the bar and harness that run over the water. Using a dual tether system, you can quickly and easily adjust the resistance of your harness, thereby increasing the intensity of your workout. All of the material here is high quality, and should last years.</p>
  <p>If you would like to add some additional features to your iPool, check out our above ground pool additions page, which includes some great tips for lights, pool decks, and plenty of other related options that you can add to your pool. We wouldn&#8217;t recommend adding toys or other family-related items to your iPool, since it&#8217;s quite small. But a good pool light can make nightly exercise sessions in the iPool an absolute blast.</p>
  <h2>Installation and Maintenance</h2>
  <p>The installation of the iPool is one of the most impressive aspects of its design. The pool can be set up in about an hour, which is incredibly impressive for any above ground pool. The lining and frame quickly and easily fold out, which means you don&#8217;t have to worry about laying a completely flat flooring underneath the pool, although we highly recommend placing your iPool on as flat a surface as possible (any bumps or dips in the floor can create pressure points and drastically reduce the life of your pool).</p>
  <p>When setting up your pool, the first step is always to construct your frame. Luckily, the iPool makes this unbelievably simple. The frame can be folded out, and then back together again within minutes. The liner is also attached to the frame, which means you can get the two most daunting steps of building an above ground pool, constructing the frame and fitting the liner, done in record time.</p>
  <p>After this, you&#8217;ll have to set up the top bar and harness. Trust us, it&#8217;s much easier to do this now than when the pool is full of water. Thankfully, this is also a very easy step. Finally, you&#8217;ll need to set up the water pump and begin filling the pool with water. It&#8217;s a good idea to hang around while water is pumped into the pool. During this time, you can check for any holes in the lining, or to see if the frame and harness have been properly secured. Fixing a mistake in the installation, or finding a flaw in your product, is much easier to do without 1,000 gallons of water in the pool.</p>
  <p>After this, you&#8217;re ready for your first exercise session in the iPool! Maintenance is quick and simple, and the folks at Fitmax provide you with chlorine packets to help keep your water fresh and clean. The packets will need to be replaced every 3&#8211;6 months, which makes the iPool one of the simplest above ground pools to maintenance we&#8217;ve ever reviewed.</p>
  <h2>Buying Options</h2>
  <p>Unlike many other pool options, the iPool comes in several different configurations, depending on the buyer and intended use. Below you&#8217;ll find a list of each variation of the iPool, and our recommendations on where to buy them.</p>
  <h3>The original iPool</h3>
  <p>The first iPool is the one we&#8217;ve focused on in this review. It comes with all the basics, has a lightening quick setup time, and is quite a small pool. However, it&#8217;s got everything you need to get started, and will last you years, as long as you understand that you will be buying a smaller pool fit for a single swimmer at one time.</p>
  <h3>The iPool D</h3>
  <p>The D variation of the iPool has some nifty extra features. While the same size as its original cousin, the D includes a much stronger pump, and a pool heater. This is a fantastic option for people who live in colder climates, and would like a heated pool to keep them exercising as long into the fall/winter as possible (but we don&#8217;t recommend swimming outdoors during the coldest winter months, especially in places where it snows).</p>
  <p>The included pump is much more powerful, being rated at 2,500 gallons per hour. The heating unit is combined with the pump, so there really isn&#8217;t much more maintenance than a normal iPool, but it is quite a bit more expensive. We recommend this option for swimmers that would like to have a warm water experience while they are exercising.</p>
  <h3>The iPool 3</h3>
  <p>The iPool 3 is the deepest pool that Fitmax currently offers. Being another foot deeper means that many swimmers will find their exercises a bit roomier, and can use the pool for more conventional methods, like splashing and wading around. However, you don&#8217;t get much else with this upgrade. This is our favorite configuration of the iPool, since it&#8217;s will accomodate taller users and doesn&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re wading around in the shallow end of a kiddie pool when you stand up. However, many people probably won&#8217;t notice much a difference between the 3 and the original iPool, so we think the iPool 3 is best suited for taller swimmers, or those that are willing to pay a little more for some extra room.</p>
  <h3>The Therapy Pool</h3>
  <p>At just 7 feet by 7 feet, the therapy pool is exceptionally small - one of the smallest pool we&#8217;ve ever reviewed. However, it&#8217;s a a great place for exercise and aqua yoga, which makes sense for many users. It doesn&#8217;t include a top bar or a harness, which means no swimming sessions. If your needs are more therapy-based, this may be the configuration for you (hence the name of the pool).</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>To sum up, the iPool is really unlike any other option out there. It&#8217;s small, and the price is high for its size, but if you want a great, compact above ground pool for exercise, this is it.</p>
  <p>But does it beat a full sized pool at the gym? Well, that&#8217;s for you to decide. Gyms carry a monthly price tag, and can be crowded. However, the experience of swimming laps in a giant pool is tough to beat. For those that want this experience, albeit a little bit dull, at their home, or those that just want to swim by themselves, it&#8217;s tough to beat the iPool.</p>
