  <h1>Blue Wave Belize Above Ground Pool Review</h1>
  <p class="introText">The Belize is a perfect choice for buyers that want a pool with everything they need included. The pool comes with a pump, ladder, outer walls, skimmer, and plenty of other additional supplies. The price is steeper than many other options, but if you&#8217;d to make a single purchase and get everything you need to get up and running with an above ground pool, the Blue Wave Belize is a strong option. Read our in depth thoughts on the Belize below.</p>
  <h2>Pool Size</h2>
  <p>The pool measures 15 feet wide and around 4.3 feet tall. This is a fantastic pool size for most needs. It&#8217;ll fit comfortably in most neighborhood lots, but still has plenty of room for families and pool parties.</p>
  <p>In relation to other above ground pool systems, the Belize is a little smaller than several other options, like the <a href="/reviews/splash-pools-deluxe/">Splash Pools Deluxe</a>. However, this also means it requires a much smaller footprint. This makes a great option for those that have smaller backyards. But don&#8217;t let the 15 ft width fool you - this is more than enough for most needs, and works great even for buyers with larger backyards.</p>
  <h2>Build Quality &amp; Warranty</h2>
  <p>The outer material is made of stainless steel, and many users report that the Belize is sturdy enough to be partially set below ground. If you&#8217;d like more information about setting above ground pools underground, you can read our in depth guide here, which includes our list of best in ground pools to place in ground.</p>
  <p>Blue Wave includes a 15-year warranty with most of their products, including the Belize. It&#8217;s a good standard warranty, although some consumers have claimed the customer service is less than exceptional. Still, reviews of the Belize state the pool is very well made, and a 15-year warranty means you and your loved ones will enjoy the pool for many, many summers.</p>
  <h1>What&#8217;s Included</h1>
  <p>With the Belize, you&#8217;re really getting everything you need to enjoy your pool for many years, all in the box. Aside from the pool, liner, and stainless steel frame, you also get a basic a frame ladder, which is solidly constructed. You get a pool skimmer, and top rails. The Belize also comes with a sand filter system and a 1hp pump, which is all you&#8217;ll need for a pool this size.</p>
  <p>Here are the specifications for the Blue Wave Belize:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Steel frame
    </li>
    <li>
      6 inch top rails and 6-inch verticals
    </li>
    <li>
      Skimmer and return system
    </li>
    <li>
      Sand Filter System w/1hp pump
    </li>
    <li>
      A-frame ladder
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The pool can hold 5,310 gallons of water comfortably. If you&#8217;re interested in other accessories, check out our recommendations in the <a href="/guides/accessories/">Above Ground Pools Accessories Guide</a>. We don&#8217;t advise you to get a larger pump, but if you&#8217;re interested automated cleaning systems, pool lights, or even a solid pool deck, we&#8217;ve got plenty of recommendations for you here.</p>
  <h2>Installation and Maintenance</h2>
  <p>Blue Wave suggests around a 6 hour setup time for the Belize, which is fairly accurate, and quite short compared to other above ground pool systems. There are several major steps when setting up an above ground pool:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Prepare the ground</li>
  <li>Build the Walls</li>
  <li>Install the Skimmer and Liner</li>
  <li>Top Rails</li>
  <li>Fill the Pool with Water</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>When preparing the ground</strong>, it&#8217;s important to make the area where you plan to construct the pool as flat and even as possible. If there are areas that are too raised or lowered, this can create pressure points in the bottom of the pool, which can cause damage the lining, or even the frame.</p>
  <p>You can use bricks, or any similar material, to level the ground before you begin building the sides of the pool. Remember, this is a very difficult step to repeat, so the more time you spend getting the ground to be completely flat, the better off you&#8217;ll be.</p>
  <p><strong>Next, you&#8217;ll want to focus on building the walls.</strong> This will require time, but it&#8217;s fairly straightforward for most manufacturers, the Belize included. The above ground pool setup will come with detailed instructions on how to build the columns and sides of the pool. It&#8217;s best to do this step with at least one other person, so you can have someone on the inside and outside of the pool walls at all times. Common tools are often all you need, as most walls are held together with screws, nuts, and washers.</p>
  <p><strong>Then it&#8217;s time to place the skimmer and liner.</strong> This is another straightforward step. It&#8217;s completely possible to insert the liner into the walls by yourself, but if you have a friend or family member helping you, this step is much, much faster and less error-prone. The exact methods will vary depending on the size of the pool and quality of the liner, but this is probably the simplest step.</p>
  <p><strong>Finally, add the top rail and fill the pool with water.</strong> This is the most satisfying step, but also takes the longest. You&#8217;ll often have to wait several hours for the pool to fill, but it&#8217;s important to keep an eye on the pool as the water piles up. If there is a hole in the lining, or some of the walls weren&#8217;t placed correctly, it&#8217;s better than you find out before the pool is completely filled with water.</p>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns while you research the Belize, or have already purchased the pool and are in the process of building it, read our guide on building an above ground pool to get some inside tips and advice. However, most above ground pool setup is just common sense, and you&#8217;ll find that taking your time and reading the instructions carefully is likely all you need to build your pool safely and in good time.</p>
  <h2>Buying Options</h2>
  <p>When it comes to protecting your family, we&#8217;d recommend doing as much research as you can stand. Pools can be a great investment, but choosing the right pool to fit your lifestyle, backyard, and family, is something that too few pool owners take into account.</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;re overwhelmed by the options you have, or just need some guidance in selecting a great above ground pool, check out our <a href="/guides/basics-101/">beginners guide</a> to selecting and building an above ground pool.</p>
  <p>For most pool owners, it&#8217;s not realistic to check out a pool before purchasing, so we recommend buying a pool from a reputable company, like Home Depot or Amazon. You&#8217;ll get the security of dealing with a large company, and typically great return policies in case you decide the pool isn&#8217;t the best fit for your family.</p>
  <p>The Belize retails for a good price on Amazon and Home Depot, and you can purchase it by visiting either one of these websites. The best part about the Belize is that you don&#8217;t really need any other items to build or run the pool. Everything you need is included in the box, and with a 6 hour setup time, you can have the pool up and running the same day it's delivered to your door.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Overall, the Blue Wave Belize isn&#8217;t exactly the biggest or best value for the money, but it&#8217;s a great all around value, and has everything you need to get started right in the box. For families with smaller yards, or for buyers that want to enjoy their pool and make just a single purchase, it&#8217;s hard to beat the Belize.</p>
  <h2>Other Choices</h2>
  <p>Not feeling the Belize? There are plenty of other options out there too. If you&#8217;re in the market for a larger pool, you can check out the <a href="/reviews/bestway-steep-pro/">Bestway Steep Pro</a>, which is in a similar price point as the Belize, but doesn&#8217;t come with as many extra options. You&#8217;ll likely have to purchase a few additional supplies to get the pool in optimum shape. However, if you can deal with the size, give the Bestway a shot. It&#8217;s still is everything you need to add a mid-sized pool to your backyard.</p>
