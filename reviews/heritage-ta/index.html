  <h1>Heritage TA Above Ground Pool Review</h1>
  <p class="introText">The Heritage line of products exhibit quality and durability that few competing above ground pools can match. If you&#8217;re the type of buyer that wants to purchase a single item, and have everything you need to supply you and your loved ones with a pool that will last for years, the Heritage Taos will be a great fit for you. However, all models are a little on the expensive side, and some of the larger pools can cost thousands of dollars, so they are quite the investment. But for those that are okay with spending a little more for a high-quality product, the Taos is a fantastic pool system.</p>
  <p>While we have lots of good things to say about Heritage products, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that it&#8217;s the right above ground pool for you. Read the rest of our thoughts below to find out of the Taos is a good fit for your family and yard.</p>
  <h2>Pool Sizes</h2>
  <p>The Taos comes in several different sizes and shapes. You can get the traditional rounded pool, or you can opt for a unique square shape with subtle rounding edges. Either way, you&#8217;re going to be getting quite the large pool, so it&#8217;s a good idea to have some space in your backyard if you&#8217;re seriously considering the Taos.</p>
  <p>The available sizes include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Rounded - 18ft and 52 inches high
    </li>
    <li>
      Rounded - 24ft and 52 inches high
    </li>
    <li>
      Rounded - 27ft and 52 inches high
    </li>
    <li>
      Square - 45ft by 18ft and 52 inches high
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are all larger pools, perfect for families or buyers that want to host large pool parties on the regular. The 18ft pool is perfect for users that need a mid-sized pool, but don&#8217;t want to spend too much, or are concerned about the available space in their backyards. Trust us, an 18ft rounded pool is quite large, and will be more than enough for a larger family.</p>
  <p>However, if you&#8217;d really like to have the extra space, you can&#8217;t go wrong with a rounded 24ft pool. This will accommodate almost any size family or party, and while it takes up a lot of room, it provides an unbeatable pool experience. And if you really need to have the largest pool you can get your hands on, the 27ft rounded pool is also available, but trust us, this thing is massive.</p>
  <p>For those that have a wide backyard but not much depth, or that want to try something more like a traditional inground pool, Heritage also sells a square pool with rounded corners. This is still a large pool, but it feels more manageable because of the size distribution. However, the square pool is very expensive, so we&#8217;d only recommend this option to buyers that really want to stay away from the typical round above ground pools.</p>
  <h2>Quality</h2>
  <p>Heritage products carry a high price tag, and it shows in the materials they use. For your purchase, you will have everything you need to get started, and beyond that, you will be able to have outdoor pool fun for years. The team at Heritage have made sure that every item in the box is high-quality, so you can trust that you&#8217;re getting what you pay for.</p>
  <p>The steel ledge that sits on top of the frame is extremely durable, and while we wouldn&#8217;t recommend sitting on top of the ledge, it provides some extra reinforcements to the walls and frame. The liner is high-quality vinyl, and should last at least 10 years, while the ladder is incredibly sturdy - one of the best ladders we&#8217;ve seen included in a pool.</p>
  <h2>What&#8217;s Included</h2>
  <p>The Heritage Taos has everything you need to keep your pool running for years. In the box you get:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Steel frame with a steel top ledge for reinforcement
    </li>
    <li>
      Resin ladder with flip up staircase
    </li>
    <li>
      16&quot; sand filter with a 1hp motor
    </li>
    <li>
      Premium all weather vinyl liner
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The pump is extremely high-quality - while it&#8217;s not the most powerful pump you can get for a larger pool, at just 1 horsepower, it&#8217;s built well, and has a solid filter system. Everything else included with the Taos is quality, and the liner has a nice, clean appearance that will make your pool look fresh and inviting at all times of the year.</p>
  <p>You will have to perform some maintenance on the pool, like checking the filter and cleaning the lining. This will help prevent algae from building up in the pool, and will greatly increase the lifespan of the Taos, or any other above ground pool system you choose. The Taos also comes with a 25-year warranty.</p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>Like most other above ground pools, the Taos will take you a good afternoon or two to install. While we don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll need any professional help (although this is always an option), you will need to have some space time and a few tools to get the Taos set up correctly.</p>
  <p>The first step with any above ground pool, and by far the most important and overlooked one, is to lay the ground. You want to map out the area where you&#8217;ll be setting up your pool, and make sure the ground is entirely flat. Any dips or bumps in the floor will cause pressure points in the lining, which can drastically reduce the lifespan of your pool. A good tip is to measure the outline of your pool, and then use a few tools to make sure the bottom is as flat as possible.</p>
  <p>After you&#8217;ve prepared the ground, it&#8217;s time to lay out the frame. This is probably the most intimidating process, but take your time. The frame is what keeps the walls in place and prevents water from gushing out into your yard, so you&#8217;ll want to make sure each piece is properly secured before moving on to the next section. If you have a few days to set the pool up, we&#8217;d recommend taking an entire afternoon to lay the ground, and another one to set up the frame. This way you can make sure that the pool is coming together correctly.</p>
  <p>After the frame, it&#8217;s time to set up the walls and lay out the liner. This is relatively simple, and will be straightforward with the Taos, since it includes a simple overlapping liner that is easy to stretch and fit to suit your needs.</p>
  <p>Finally, it&#8217;s time to fill the pool with water. We recommend taking some time to watch the pool as it fills, since any leaks or weak points in the liner and frame are easy to spot while the pool is filling. It&#8217;s much better to catch a flaw with only a few dozen gallons of water in the pool, than to realize you&#8217;ve made a mistake when the pool has over a thousand gallons of water in it.</p>

  <h2>Buying Options</h2>
  <p>We believe many online retailers offer the best buying experience for above ground pool customers. If you&#8217;re never bought a pool before, a larger company, like Amazon or Home Depot, will provide you with excellent customer service, a national network filled with hundreds of warehouses, and the best prices.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>We love the Heritage products, and the Taos is no exception. It is on the pricier side of above ground pools, but you get a high-quality set up, and won&#8217;t need to make any additional purchases to provide you and your loved ones with years of pool use.</p>
  <p>However, if you like the Heritage, but aren&#8217;t sure you are ready to spend that much money, we&#8217;d also recommend using an Intex pool. The setup on pools like this are very straightforward, and you&#8217;ll find that they provide incredible value for money. While the materials and warranty may not be at the same level as the Heritage products, the price is tough to beat on the Intex lineup of pools.</p>
