  <h1>Intex Metal Frame Pool Set Review</h1>
  <p class="introText">Intex is known for straightforward, portable pools, and their Metal Frame Pool Set is no exception. However, this product has the added advantage of a sturdy frame and PVC sidewalls. If you&#8217;re interested in a long-lasting pool that&#8217;s still easy to setup and use, the Metal Frame option from Intex is a fantastic choice. But how does it compare to other Intex options, like the <a href="/reviews/intex-easy-set/">Easy Set</a>, and will it be the right choice for you? Keep reading to find out our thoughts.</p>
  <h2>Pool Sizes</h2>
  <p>Like many other Intex products, the Metal Frame Set comes in several different sizes and price points. The entry point is a 12 feet wide pool that stands 30 inches high. This is a great pool for younger children, or for first-time pool buyers that want to see what type of use their pool gets. It&#8217;s also a very portable option, which makes it perfect for buyers that want to store their pool during colder months.</p>
  <p>Intex also offers a larger option, which is 15 feet wide and 48 inches tall. This size is much, much larger, and will fit just about any family. It&#8217;s also a great option for medium-sized pool parties, while still being somewhat portable. As with all Intex products, the pool is easy to setup and teardown for those that want to put their pool away in storage every year.</p>
  <p>Finally, the largest option is an 18 feet wide and 48 inches tall. This is quite a large pool, and is the perfect choice for families that want an all-in-one package, but still want to prioritize value and portability, although this is the least portable of Intex&#8217;s Steel Frame options. Thankfully, the pool makes up for a lack of portability with its sheer size - it&#8217;s the perfect choice for families of four or more, or buyers that want to host large pool parties.</p>
  <h2>Build Quality &amp; Warranty</h2>
  <p>The steel frame and PVC sides make this one sturdy pool, especially considering the price point. Rest assured, this product is going to last you many years, and will still be comfortable and easy to transport or store.</p>
  <p>No matter which size you choose, you are going to get a quality product with plenty of safety features to accomodate larger pool parties and extended use. However, compared to Intex&#8217;s Easy Set option, which is much smaller but has inflatable edges, the Metal Frame pools just aren&#8217;t quite as safe for younger children. Like most pools with metal or stainless steel frames, it&#8217;s a little too easy to hit the edge of the pool for younger kids. However, if you have young children or want to take extra safety measures, it&#8217;s easy enough to add some padding to the edge of your pool.</p>
  <h2>What&#8217;s Included</h2>
  <p>With any option, you&#8217;ll get the pool walls, liner, and metal frame. Several configurations of the Metal Frame pool come with a solid pump/filter system, which is a solid add-on for buyers that don&#8217;t want to buy a pump separately. </p>
  <p>A great feature of the Intex pools, especially if you plan to take the Metal Frame Set down and transport/store it frequently, is the drain system. It fits any standard hose, which means you can drain the water as far away from the pool as you need. This is a small inclusion, but can be fantastic in certain situations where you want to keep 1,000+ gallons of water from getting too close to the foundation of your above ground pool.</p>
  <p>One important thing to mention is that several options don&#8217;t come with a ladder, so you&#8217;ll need to purchase one on your own. This is an important decision, as you&#8217;ll want to choose a ladder that will last just as long as your pool.</p>
  <p>You can read our thoughts on the best pool ladders you can get for your above ground pool in our <a href="/guides/accessories/">Accessories Guide</a>.</p>
  <h2>Installation &amp; Maintenance</h2>
  <p>Like the rest of Intex&#8217;s products, the Steel Frame set is extremely easy to set up and use. While not quite as quick to get up and running as the similar Easy Set, the Steel Frame pool can quickly be ready to go, and can also be easily taken down, for those that want to do seasonal storage with their above ground pool.</p>
  <p>Like any other pool, you&#8217;ll want to make sure to flatten the area where you&#8217;ll place your pool as much as you possibly can. Any bumps can cause a pressure point, which can greatly reduce the life of your liner. This is the most important step in setting up your pool, even if you plan to tear it down and store it seasonally. Taking 30 minutes to properly prepare the ground for your pool can provide a massive boost to the product&#8217;s lifespan.</p>
  <p>Intex also includes a handy DVD with instructions on how to get the pool setup. You&#8217;ll construct the frame first, and then add in the wall/liner. After that, you can work on either the included pump/filter system or a separate pump of your own. The final step is to start filling the pool with water. If you can, try to check on your pool regularly while it fills with water, just in case there are any holes in the liner/wall. It&#8217;s better to catch something like this early on, before your pool is completely filled with water.</p>
  <h2>Buying Options</h2>
  <p>For a product like this, we recommend buying online from a reputable dealer, like Amazon.com or Home Depot. They provide great customer service and typically also boast the best prices. However, Intex also sells many of their products directly online, which is another great option.</p>
  <p>However, if you&#8217;ve got a trusted local pool dealer, it can be great to check out a few different pool options and be able to see them in person.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Metal Frame Pool by Intex is one of the best options at this price point. It&#8217;s tough to find a better combination of durability, mobility, and ease of setup. No matter what type of pool size you&#8217;re after, you can likely find a great option for your needs.</p>
  <p>However, it&#8217;s also worth noting that the Metal Frame is not the best option for users that want to easily upgrade their pool. For that, you may want to try the <a href="/reviews/splash-pools-deluxe/">Splash Pools Deluxe</a>, or even the <a href="/reviews/heritage-ta/">Heritage TA</a>. While they are a bit pricier, they provide even better value, and can be expanded on much more than the Intex products can be.</p>
  <p>For families that want a sturdy, reliable pool at a great price point, it&#8217;s tough to beat the Intex Metal Frame Pool.</p>
