  <h1>Embassy Above Ground Pool Review</h1>
  <p class="introText">The Embassy Pool isn&#8217;t the most well-known product, especially compared to industry standards like Intex, but it has lots of positive reviews, great build quality, and everything you need to provide a great pool for you and your loved ones for years to come. The rugged materials are top-notch, and its single size option is perfect for larger families and pool parties. In short, it&#8217;s fully capable of standing next to all the competing above ground pools out there.</p>
  <p>But does that mean it&#8217;s the right pool for you? Keep reading for our thoughts on the Embassy, it&#8217;s build quality, and what you get with your purchase.</p>
  <h2>Pool Size</h2>
  <p>Unlike many competing manufacturers, the Embassy Pool only comes in a single size - 18ft and 52 inches tall. This is the perfect midsize pool. It will comfortably fit larger families, but won&#8217;t take up too much space in your yard. </p>
  <p>We often see many manufacturers offering three, four, or even five different sizes for an above ground pool, which can make many buyers question which size is right for their yard and needs. The important thing to remember is most rounded pools, after about 15ft or so, will be more than enough. So an 18ft pool will feel massive, especially if you have younger children. If we had to pick an all around size that would suit most buyers, 18ft by 52 inches tall would be it.</p>
  <h2>Quality</h2>
  <p>Quality is where the Embassy above ground pool shines. Everything included in the package is extremely well made, and the cream colored looks of the pool will blend with just about any backyard.</p>
  <p>The frame is steel, and the walls are baked enamel, which is extremely resilient and can take years of abuse and water damage. The pool liner is vinyl, which is the industry standard, and the filter is well-built and has enough power to keep the pool clean and regulated for a long time.</p>
  <h2>What&#8217;s Included</h2>
  <p>The Embassy has everything you need, even small extras that many first-time pool buyers forget about. Here&#8217;s what you get in the box:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Frame and walls
    </li>
    <li>
      Pool liner
    </li>
    <li>
      Skimmer
    </li>
    <li>
      17&#8220; sand filter with a 1hp pump
    </li>
    <li>
      52&#8221; platform ladder
    </li>
    <li>
      Pool vacuum
    </li>
    <li>
      Net/brush
    </li>
    <li>
      Cooling pole
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Embassy&#8217;s tactic seems to be including everything but the kitchen sink with your purchase. With a price of around 2,000 dollars, this is a great deal. You won&#8217;t have to make any additional purchases to enjoy years of pool fun with your family.</p>
  <p>The ladder is solid, and the pool vacuum is a welcome extra that will keep the liner clean. While the skimmer isn&#8217;t completely necessary, it&#8217;s still a welcome addition, as is the colling pole.</p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>The Embassy is a typical above ground pool, which means setup and maintenance can be a bit of a burden if you aren&#8217;t prepared. Rest easy though, as it&#8217;s nowhere near as much work if you do a little research before you start setting up the pool.</p>
  <p>The first step, with any above ground pool, is to start preparing the ground well before you set up the frame. With the Embassy, it would be best to pick the spot where you&#8217;re setting up the pool, and measure an 18ft round spot. Once you&#8217;ve outlined the spot, spend some time, at least an hour or so, making the ground as flat and even as possible. This prevents bumps in the surface, which can wear down the liner over time. Making the ground flat is the most critical step, as it can drastically increase the life of your pool, but is often overlooked.</p>
  <p>After that, it&#8217;s time to build the frame and set the walls. This is relatively straightforward with the Embassy, and step by step instructions are included. However, this can take you several hours, especially if you&#8217;re consistently double checking your work or attempting the setup by yourself (although we&#8217;d highly recommend building the frame and walls with someone else - it will make the project go by much faster).</p>
  <p>Once the outer walls of the pool are constructed, it&#8217;s time to stretch out the liner and set up the pump. The liner can be a bit tricky at first, since it will have to be as tight as possible. This can also take some time, as you&#8217;ll want to triple check the floor of the pool for any dips or bumps, but it&#8217;s time well spent since this will make the floor of the pool smoother.</p>
  <p>Finally, you&#8217;ll need to fill the pool with water. While this can take some time, we recommend checking on the pool every 15&#8211;20 minutes while it fills, since this is a great chance for you to catch errors. Accidental tearing the liner, or a flaw in the frame, is very easy to catch at this point, before the pool is filled with over a thousand gallons of water.</p>
  <h2>Buying Options</h2>
  <p>Places like Amazon and Home Depot will offer great value for money, and have hundreds of warehouses across the country, which means your product will get to you very quickly and will be in good condition. </p>
  <p>With the Embassy, it&#8217;s a pretty easy decision - you only have one option for the pool, and it includes basically everything you need. We feel this is a great tactic, as most first-time pool buyers don&#8217;t really know what they need. For a good price, you&#8217;ll have a large pool, with a great liner and pump, and all the extras you need.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>We highly recommend this product for first-time pool buyers that want a quality product. It can&#8217;t quite compete with other &#8220;everything included&#8221; companies, like Intex, in terms of value, but it isn&#8217;t trying to be. The Embassy above ground pool is aiming to be of the highest quality, while still providing all you need at a good price. And in our minds, it absolutely nails it. Highly recommended.</p>
  <p>If you like the Embassy, but aren&#8217;t sure you&#8217;re ready to spend that much money on a pool, check out our review of the Intex pools. They are great systems that provide outstanding value for money, and are incredibly easy to set up. The <a href="/reviews/intex-easy-set/">Intex Easy Set</a>, while a smaller pool, can be built in a fraction of the time as the Embassy.</p>
  <p>For some pool buyers, they aren&#8217;t interested in getting a large pool with all the extras included in the box - they would much rather purchase a pool, and then pick the pump and cleaning materials that suit them the most. In these cases, we recommend the <a href="/reviews/bestway-steep-pro/">Bestway Steep Pro</a>. It comes with an incredibly well-built frame and walls, but doesn&#8217;t include a pump or anything else. It&#8217;s the perfect starter kit for do-it-yourself users that want to make the above ground pool that&#8217;s tailored to their individual needs.</p>
