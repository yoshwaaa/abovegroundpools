  <h1>Above Ground Pool Liner Guide</h1>
  <p>A pool liner is what covers the inside of your above ground pool. It coats both the floor of your pool and the inside of the frame and ring (the sides of the pool). High-quality liners provide three major benefits to a pool:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>They stop water from leaking out of the pool</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This may seem obvious, but a good liner needs to keep water from leaking through the ground or out of the sides of the pool. This is the liners most basic function. It&#8217;s important to note that more expensive liners tend to last longer, which means your pool will last much longer. While the frames for most pools are durable enough to last for years, a cheap liner can wear out much, much faster, and could eventually tear, which results in water leaking.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>A good liner provides a nice appearance</li>
  </ol>
  <p>While some buyers may find the appearance to not be an essential part of the pool, please remember that above ground pools are quite the investment for most people, and will likely sit in your background for years. So while appearance may seem trivial, it is important. The best liners have a friendly, clean look to them, often making the bottom of the pool look like marble or concrete. It may not seem like much, but this goes a long way to making your pool seem more inviting or clean.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Liners must also prevent algae</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This is true, but most of the algae prevention is up to you, the owner. It&#8217;s your job to maintain the pool and keep your liner clean. However, the best liners will be constructed properly and made with high-quality materials, which means that maintaining a fresh, clean pool will be easier.</p>
  <h2>How To Choose A Good Liner</h2>
  <p>As with most above ground pool equipment, the two things to consider are cost, appearance, and size. Once you&#8217;ve decided on your pool, or if you already have a pool and want to replace your current liner, the size has already been determined, so it&#8217;s up to you to find a liner that will fit your current frame correctly. This is relatively easy, since most major pool liner manufacturers will tailor liners to fit your individual pool. If nothing else, you can purchase a bigger pool liner and remove the excess material.</p>
  <p>For features, the only real option here is the color and patterns on the liner, which is entirely up to you and your loved ones. If we could give you advice on this point, we&#8217;d say to stay away from liners with really strong color schemes, as this can get tiring to look at. It&#8217;s also a good idea to avoid liners that have too many colors, since the liner will fade over time, and while a vibrant mix of colors can be very striking initially, after a year or so of sun/chlorine wear, it can make your pool look cheap.</p>
  <p>When it comes to cost, this is entirely determined by the type of material you choose. The most popular material for liners is vinyl, and this is what we&#8217;d recommend. It has a nice balance of affordability and durability.</p>
  <h2>More About Vinyl Pool Liners</h2>
  <p>Vinyl is a fantastic material. It&#8217;s smooth to the touch, can handle a good amount of abuse, and withstands water damage very well. It&#8217;s also the easiest of all the major types of pool liners to install and use. If you need to replace a liner in the future, vinyl is a cost-effective solution, and if you can&#8217;t find one in the right size for your pool, it&#8217;s nice to know you can always purchase a larger one and cut it down to the right size.</p>
  <p>However, vinyl doesn&#8217;t last forever. Most pool owners report that their liners usually last a little under 10 years. While this is still a large amount of time, it does mean that families purchasing an above ground pool will likely see at least one liner change in the product&#8217;s lifetime. In the future, if you decide to move your pool to a different location, you probably won&#8217;t be able to use the liner again. Once a liner has been stretched out, it&#8217;s relatively impossible for that same liner to be stretched again, which can be a pain for buyers that are renting or considering a move in the next few years.</p>
  <p>Another important note is that liners can be damaged over time by bumps in the pool floor. Over several years, these bumps create pressure points, which lead to weakened spots in the liner. This makes tears much more common. You can drastically increase the life of your liner by preparing the ground before you begin setting up the frame - the flatter you make the pool site, the longer your liner will last.</p>
  <p>Thankfully, pool liners are very affordable and easy to install, especially if you use vinyl. If you are concerned about eventually replacing your liner, or are currently in need of one, rest assured that the price will always be low, and a well-built liner will last you many years.</p>
  <h2>What Are The Types of Pool Liners?</h2>
  <p>If you have an above ground pool, you&#8217;ve got several major choices between pool liners. Each of the major types of pool liners is typically made of the same material, but the way in which you set them up is different. There are 4 major types of pool liners to choose from: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Overlap liners
    </li>
    <li>
      J-hook liners
    </li>
    <li>
      Beaded liners
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Overlap liners are the cheapest option for pool owners. They have plastic strips on the outside that attach to the outside of your pool and hold the liner in the place. The major downside with this type of liner is that it usually overlaps the sides of your pool, and will be slightly visible on the outside wall, hence the name &#8220;Overlap Liners&#8221;. This can be a deal breaker for many buyers, since it will negatively impact the appearance of your pool and some people think it looks cheap. However, these are the most affordable type of liner, so it will work for those that want to get an above ground pool set up with the lowest cost possible.</p>
  <p>J-Hook liners are the easiest of the types to set up. The edges are shaped like a &#8220;J&#8221;, and fit nicely over the side of the pool wall. This type of liner is also very attractive, and many pool owners report that the inside of their above ground pool looks similar to an inground pool with a J-Hook liner. They are a bit more expensive that an overlap liner, but we think the ease of use, and the more attractive appearance more than make up for the slight increase in price.</p>
  <p>Beaded liners are a great option for many pool owners because they aren&#8217;t visible from the outside of the pool, unlike overlap liners or j-hook liners. The beaded material sits under the frame, and the result is a neat, clean look to your pool. However, one of the major drawbacks is water leakage. Because the liner doesn&#8217;t fully cover the wall, water can get splashed in between the liner and the wall, and may cause damage over time. However, if you have a good frame system, this negatives the water damage, since the frame covers up the beaded liner. It&#8217;s also important to get a proper measurement for the exact size of your pool before purchasing a beaded liner, as it must fit as tightly as possible. If the liner is even a little bit too small, it won&#8217;t secure properly to the pool wall, and this can cause water leakage.</p>
  <h2>Selecting the Right Above Ground Pool Liner</h2>
  <p>Vinyl liners are perfect for above ground pool, but how do you find the right one for your setup? While appearance is important, there are other things to take into considering when choosing a liner. The three main things to base your decision on are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      How large the liner is
    </li>
    <li>
      The thickness (quality/durability) of the liner
    </li>
    <li>
      The appearance of the liner
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>First, let&#8217;s talk about the size of the liner. Liners are meant to be stretched to fit the pool, but only to a certain extent. For instance, if you purchase a liner that&#8217;s only meant to fit pools up to 15ft, and you have a pool that&#8217;s 18ft, it will likely fit, but we can&#8217;t recommend this. In fact, over time this can wear out the liner and severely impact durability.</p>
  <p>The thickness of the liner has the most profound effect on the price, but thicker liners will last much longer. The majority of pool liners are about 20 mil thick, which will give you average durability and a pretty long lifespan for the liner - about 10 years at most. These are also cheaper options, and are easily and quickly replaced. It&#8217;s important to note that a 20 mil can last 10 years if it&#8217;s taken care of properly. Without consistent cleaning, the liner won&#8217;t protect as well against algae and water corrosion, which means it can last as little as 3&#8211;5 years.</p>
  <p>27 mil liners are the next step up, and while they are more expensive, the increase in durability is well worth for many buyers. While they will still require constant cleaning and repair, they provide added protection against water and UV rays, which are another common factor when considering the lifespan of the liner (this is another reason why a pool cover is a great way to extend the life of your pool - read our guide to pool covers here).</p>
  <p>Finally, the 30 mil liners are much more resilient than the other options, but are also the most expensive. This is a good option, but it&#8217;s also the most difficult to install, as a thicker liner won&#8217;t stretch as easily. </p>
  <p>The design is the last part in choosing a liner, and it&#8217;s the one that you&#8217;ll notice every day you use the pool. Most patterns will make the bottom of the liner look neat and clean, which makes the pool look more inviting. The other major choice is between a lighter color palette and a darker one. The lighter liners will show sun damage less, but show stains and algae more easily. Darker liners will fade out with the sun more over time, but show stains less easily and also make the pool look deeper than it is.</p>
  <h2>A final word about pool liners</h2>
  <p>Picking the right liner can seem intimidating, but it can be much more straightforward if you pick a few major points and find the liner that meets those requirements.</p>
  <p>First, you&#8217;ll need to pick a liner that&#8217;s the right size, or at least be willing to purchase a larger liner and cut it to the right size. The pool shape will also dictate what type of liner you purchase.</p>
  <p>If you use an overlapping liner, the design will be very simple, since it will hang over the sides of the pool. These are also easy to setup and maintain, but don&#8217;t exactly give you the best appearance. The good news is that, even for above ground pools that were created with overlapping liners in mind, another type of liner will likely work just as well.</p>
  <p>J-Hook liners will look much cleaner on an above ground pool from the outside, and the tailored size allows the pool design to be more visually pleasing. However, this also means that you&#8217;ll need a precise measurement of your pool before choosing the j-hook liner for you. This is pretty easily done, and you can often order a liner and make it fit whatever type of pool you have.</p>
  <p>Expandable liners are also available for above ground pools that are abnormally deep, but for most buyers, the typical liner types are more than big enough. The most important thing to remember is to get a correct measurement of your pool, and choose a liner that fits that measurement as closely as possible. It&#8217;s always safer to get a slightly bigger liner than to choose something that&#8217;s a bit too small.</p>
