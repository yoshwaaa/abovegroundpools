  <h1>Above Ground Pool Repair Guide</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Just like any other type of home equipment, an above ground pool gets wear over time, and will require maintenance. However, the big difference with a pool is that the activities centered around them - namely parties and &#8220;rough housing&#8221; - can cause increased wear. But with the proper preventative steps, and a good dose of maintenance and regular checks, you can ensure your pool and all the supplementary equipment stay in good shape for years to come. Here is our guide to pool maintenance.</p>
  <p>The guide will be broken down into two major parts - maintenance and fixes. The maintenance section will cover the things you should be monitoring or doing as frequently as possible (to a certain extent - in most cases doing a full cleaning of your pool daily isn&#8217;t really necessary). The fixes section will cover what happens if you notice a leak in your liner or have some rust building up on the pool wall.</p>
  <h2>Cleaning</h2>
  <p>Cleaning your pool is very straightforward. The daily needs will depend on what&#8217;s around the pool. If you have a bunch of trees in your yard, or live in a windy/rainy climate, you&#8217;ll likely need to clean your pool more frequently.</p>
  <p>The first part of cleaning a pool is <strong>skimming</strong>. There are two major types of skimmers that clean debris from your pool:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Wall skimmers
    </li>
    <li>
      Leaf skimmers
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Wall skimmers are basic devices that work with your filtering system to remove debris from the top of your pool. They work great for simple cleaning tasks, but if you&#8217;ve got a lot of trees or a storm comes through, you&#8217;re going to need to use a leaf skimmer.</p>
  <p>Leaf skimmers often come with extension poles, which allow you to stay outside of the pool and still skim leaves and other debris from the top of the pool. You can also use a leaf skimmer without the extension, and just jump in the pool and skim the leaves (especially useful for hot days in warmer climates).</p>
  <p>There are two ways you can vacuum the floor of an above ground pool:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Manually using a vacuum pump and hose
    </li>
    <li>
      Setting up an automatic vacuum
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Manually vacuuming a pool will require using a vacuum head, and attaching it to a vacuum hose that&#8217;s connected to the filter system. You&#8217;ll connect the hose to the skimmer basket and let it fill with water. This will push debris at the bottom of the pool through the hose, and out into the skimmer. This requires more work than an automatic vacuuming system, but is more effective. You&#8217;ll often catch more debris using a manual vacuum than by simply relying on an automatic system.</p>
  <p>However, an automatic vacuum is still a huge convenience. You won&#8217;t have to worry about manually vacuuming your pool, unless a storm or some strong wind sends a lot of debris into the water. There are plenty of great automatic systems. You can read our thoughts on the best automatic vacuums for above ground pool cleaning here.</p>
  <h2>Filtering</h2>
  <p>Pool pumps should be run at least several hours a day. Most pool owners say they try to run the pump for around 8 hours a day, although running it more is always a good idea. Just remember, the more frequently you run the pump, the more electricity you&#8217;ll use. If you&#8217;re looking at a new above ground pool, or thinking about replacing your current pool pump, you should know that different pool pumps will work more efficiently and use less power. You can read our thoughts on the different types of <a href="guides/pump-guide/">pool pumps here</a>.</p>
  <p>It&#8217;s important to make sure you run the pool pump at least once a day, otherwise the water will turn green very quickly. There are three things that can help you with your daily filtering:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pool pump timers
    </li>
    <li>
      Backwashing
    </li>
    <li>
      Basket cleaning
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pool timers will help you run the pool frequently, and can also monitor how much the pump has been running. You can usually find cheap, effective pool timers that plug into an outlet, and will control how often the pump runs. They are easy to use and very affordable, and will keep you from forgetting to turn the pool pump on daily (remember, even forgetting the run the pump for a day can turn the water green). You&#8217;ll want to set the timer for at least 8 hours a day or longer, especially during warmer months.</p>
  <p>Backwashing means that you reverse the water flow through the filter, which will push out the dirt that has gotten stuck in the pump and filter system. Most filter systems, especially sand and DE filters, will have this option, which is usually just a valve that you can easily reverse. You should be checking the pressure gauge on your pump frequently, and make sure you understand how much pressure your pump normally operates at. If you notice the pressure is high, usually around 8 pounds higher than normal, reverse the valve and start backwashing dirt out of your filter.</p>
  <p>Important note - if you have a cartridge filter system, you cannot do backwashing. Instead, you have to shut off the pump and remove the filter. Once you&#8217;ve taken the filter out, clean it manually and wash it off.</p>
  <p>There are two baskets with any filter system - a skimmer basket and a pump basket. The skimmer basket will collect debris and sand much more frequently, so make sure to clean this out as much as you can. Many pool owners also forget to clean their pump basket, since it doesn&#8217;t get dirty as quickly as the skimmer basket, but it&#8217;s important to make sure both baskets are clean. Try to clean the pump basket once a week, and the skimmer basket every day.</p>
  <h2>Chemicals</h2>
  <p>Another major factor to consider when maintaining any pool is the chemical level. You&#8217;ll want a consistent amount of chlorine in the pool at all times, which means you need to test the water several days a week, and have a good idea what you&#8217;d like the chlorine level to stay at. If you notice the levels dropping, then it&#8217;s time to adjust the balance of chemicals within your pool water.</p>
  <p>There are three major steps to maintaining a good chemical balance:</p>
  <p><strong>Frequent water tests</strong> - you can either use testing strips or a test kit. There are several types of test kits, and they tend to be very accurate, so the specific kind you get isn&#8217;t too important (you may want to check reviews online before purchasing a test kit, just to make sure). However, liquid kits are the most accurate at water testing.</p>
  <p><strong>Chlorine levels</strong> - if you notice the water needs more chlorine, you&#8217;ll want to add some tablet to your floater. In case you don&#8217;t know what a floater is, it&#8217;s a small plastic device that floats on the surface of your pool and holds several chlorine tablets, which dissolve slowly and maintain chlorine presence in th water.</p>
  <p>You&#8217;ll want your chlorine levels to stay above 1.0 ppm, which will prevent the water from turning green, so long as the pump continues to run as well. If you do notice the chlorine levels rapidly dropping, or if they are at 0 for any reason, then you&#8217;ll need to shock the pool using powdered chlorine.</p>
  <p>Finally, you&#8217;ll want to test for pH levels in your pool. If you notice the pH levels are too low or have risen too high, then you&#8217;ll want to add pool pH or alkalinity liquid to your pool to keep the pH levels in check.</p>
  <h2>Protecting Your Pool</h2>
  <p>Now that you&#8217;ve got a good handle on the maintenance aspect of your pool, there are some small steps you can take to prevent damage to the liner, pool wall, and vital pool equipment.</p>
  <h3>Pool Walls</h3>
  <p>Make sure that there isn&#8217;t any chance of another object colliding with your poll wall. If there are trees close by, make sure they are healthy and they look strong. Weaker trees can easily fall and damage or destroy your pool wall. Lawn equipment and children&#8217;s toys can also knock into the pool wall, which can dent or damage it as well. Standing on a pool wall is especially dangerous, since the walls are never meant to withstand that much pressure. You will risk the immediate danger of breaking the pool wall, but even if it doesn&#8217;t bend or break, over time this can weaken the pool wall and shorten the lifespan of your pool.</p>
  <p>Pool liners are very sensitive to chemical balances, so by keeping consistent water and chlorine levels, you&#8217;re doing a lot to protect the liner. However, holes or tears are common issues with pool liners, so if you think you may have a leak in your liner, scroll down to read our liner repair guide (which also has information on how to quickly find liner leaks). Pool toys are often the culprit behind a puncture in the liner, so take that into consideration when purchasing new toys for your family.</p>
  <p>Pool equipment is the last major type of pool material that you need to pay attention to, but as long as the pump is cleaned regularly, you should be in a good place. Just remember that the pump does have a high amount of pressurized water running through, and if you have a heating system, it may be hot. Just be careful, and if you suspect there may be an issue with any of your pool equipment, give the manufacturer a call as soon as possible.</p>
  <h2>Dealing with a Leak</h2>
  <p>Above ground pools can leak from several different areas, and for many different reasons. This is one of the most difficult and frequent problems with above ground pools. But the good news is you have plenty of options when it comes to repairing leaks, and a watchful eye can help you spot wear and tear in your liner and pump, allowing you to prevent leaks before they even start.</p>
  <p>If you do spot a leak, make sure you repair it quickly, or else it can become a much larger problem. A large leak can damage the ground around a pool, and some leaks can even permanently harm your pool wall. So it&#8217;s always a good idea to fix a leak as you as you spot it.</p>
  <p>Thankfully, above ground pools have one major advantage to concrete in ground pools when it comes to detecting leaks - everything is above the ground, of course! Plumbing leaks, pump breakage, and even liner tears are much easier to spot with an above ground pool system. The hoses that connect your pump to the pool water are usually flexible, and will resist breaks, but they can still tear.</p>
  <p>Before you start working on a leak, please do some additional checks around your pool to make sure the cleaning chemicals are in good shape, and make sure the pool is relatively clean. If the pool water is discolored, or the mix of chemicals are too strong, it can make finding a leak very difficult, and will also inhibit your progress on any repairs (who wants to try to fix a leak in murky water?).</p>
  <h3>Checking for Leaks</h3>
  <p>Always check the hoses connected to your pool - either to a draining system, or more likely to an attached pump. There could be water leaking out of either end of the hose, this is a very simple fix - just tighten either end of the hose (after turning off the pump and filter system of course), and you should be good to go. You may also need to replace the pool hose if you find a tear in it, or if the connected ends don&#8217;t stop leaking once you&#8217;ve tightened them.</p>
  <p>For those with solid PVC pipes that run between their pool and the pump system, make sure you check for cracks in the pipes, and check for any leaks in the joints or at the endpoints. Fittings can easily break or become dislodged from other pieces, and this is also a relatively easy fix - turn off the pump, and either patch or replace the existing PVC pipe. This is especially common in between hot and cold seasons, as turning the pump on after it&#8217;s been off for several months can put pressure on the pipes and cause them to separate from other pieces.</p>
  <h3>Checking the Filter System</h3>
  <p>The filter is hardly ever checked for leaks, but over time a small leak in a filter can cause a lot of damage to your pool, and may even destroy the filter. So it&#8217;s always a good idea to check your filter for leaks. If you see any leaks, even if they are just small drops, make sure the check the ground beneath your filter, and see if any water has fallen there. This is more difficult than it seems, since water on dirt or grass can be hard to spot. It&#8217;s also difficult in many cases because pool owners will check the filter after having been in the pool, where it&#8217;s easy to accidentally splash water on the surrounding ground. Our advice is to check the filter before taking a swim on a warm day, and make sure no one else has used the pool for a good while. Turn the filter on and check the ground after a few minutes. If you see water, then there is a good chance you may have a leak.</p>
  <p>For those with more advanced filter systems like a multiport valve, also check the wash line in the back, to make sure you aren&#8217;t losing any additional water here. The multiport gaskets can cause a lot of issues, especially if they&#8217;ve been stretched out. Many pool owners have their backwash line far away from the pool, which makes leaks much harder to spot.</p>
  <h3>Finding leaks in the pool liner</h3>
  <p>You have a couple of options when checking for holes in a pool liner. The first and simplest way is to simply spend some time looking at the liner to see if there are any holes. However, with many liners (especially those with busy color schemes), you may find this difficult as the color variations can make smaller tears disappear.</p>
  <p>If you suspect you have a leak, it may be best to actually get inside the pool and get a pair of underwater goggles. This can help you get up close to the liner, and by swimming around the pool with your face submerged and close to the liner, you&#8217;ll really be able to inspect for leaks or tears. Again, this also requires that the pool is clean and there aren&#8217;t too many chemicals in the water. A dirty pool will be difficult to see in, and a pool with too many chemicals can severely damage your eyes and skin if you stay in for too long. If there are too many chemicals or the pool water is starting to turn green, take time to clean your pool and let the cleaning chemical wear off before checking for a leak.</p>
  <h3>Using Food Coloring to Find a Leak</h3>
  <p>If you still haven&#8217;t been able to find a leak in the liner, but still suspect there may be some water leakage, food coloring can be a great way to find any tears or breaks. All you need is some food coloring, especially something that is easily seen with your liner - in many cases this will be darker in color. Load the food coloring into a syringe or small eyedropper, get in the pool, and go near the area where you suspect there may be a leak. Squirt a small bit of food coloring near the possible leak, and see if it gets pulled out of the pool through the leak. This may take several tries, as you may not be entirely sure where the leak is, but after several tries you should be able to confirm if you have a leak or not.</p>
  <p>In some cases, you may not actually see the food coloring being pulled out of the pool. It will often just disappear very quickly. This also confirms the leak, since the food coloring is still being pulled out of the pool, just very quickly. This only happens if you&#8217;re close to the leak, so you&#8217;ll know there is a tear in the liner very close to where you released the food coloring.</p>
  <p>If you&#8217;ve got a pool shop in the area, there is actually pool leaking test dye that you can purchase. This product isn&#8217;t exactly necessary, but is a great option for pool owners since it&#8217;s a bit thicker and will be easier to track once you&#8217;ve released them in the pool water.</p>
  <h3>Patching the Pool Liner Hole</h3>
  <p>After you&#8217;ve found the leak, it&#8217;s time to fix it. This will require a bit of time, some extra liner material, some glue that will work with a liner (and not lose its use when underwater). and a pair of scissors. However, you can also buy a liner patch kit, which will have all the tools you&#8217;ll need to fix your leak.</p>
  <p><strong>Once you have the materials, it&#8217;s time to start repairing the hole.</strong> To start, you need to measure the width of the hole. Prepare the piece of liner that you&#8217;ll use to patch the hole, and make sure that the patch is at least an inch or two larger than the piece of liner it&#8217;s replacing. It would also be a good idea to cut the replacement liner in a circle, or at least round the corners of the patch. It may seem trivial, but cutting the replacement patch in a circle makes it much more difficult to disturb with water currents.</p>
  <p>Once you&#8217;ve got the replacement liner ready, the rest of the process is rather straightforward. Place glue on the underside of the patch, and then place it over the torn area. You may need to apply pressure for around 30 seconds to secure the patch, which can be a little difficult if the patch is at the bottom of the pool. However, once the patch has been placed, you can use your feet or another heavy object to apply pressure to the patch.</p>
  <p>After that, go through the steps of checking for a leak again - see if there has been any water that&#8217;s leaked out of the pool, or use food coloring and see if it still disappears when you release it near the leak.</p>
  <h2>Repairing Pool Walls</h2>
  <p>A damaged pool wall isn&#8217;t as common as a torn liner, but unfortunately, pool walls can be very difficult to repair. If you suspect your above ground pool has a hole in the wall, or that there might be some other damage, it&#8217;s a good idea to check the wall for any issues.</p>
  <h3>Checking the pool wall for damage</h3>
  <p>First things first - finding rust on or around your pool wall doesn&#8217;t mean that the wall has been damaged. In most cases, the rust you&#8217;ll find is simply &#8220;surface rust&#8221;, and your pool wall is actually still in good shape. In these cases, use a rust remover and some sandpaper to sand the surface rust of the walls. If you check your pool wall and find a little harmless rust, use a cleaner to remove it.</p>
  <p>The big test here is to take a solid metal tool, like a screwdriver, and gently poke at the rusted areas of the wall. If you notice large, deep chunks of rust coming off the wall, then you may have a problem. A small amount of rust doesn&#8217;t mean your wall is in danger of collapsing or is in serious danger, but if you notice that the rust has eaten through the wall, it&#8217;s time to repair your pool wall.</p>
  <h3>Gauging how bad the wall is damaged</h3>
  <p>If you do find a hole or a weak spot in the wall, you will have to repair it, but depending on where the hole is, this could be a quick fix or a major undertaking.</p>
  <p>If the hole is higher up in the wall, then that means there isn&#8217;t that much pressure being placed on it, and it&#8217;ll likely be a quick fix that won&#8217;t take too long. You can use some basic sheet metal to secure the area around the hole or weak spot. Fasten the metal using some duct tape, and you should be good to go.</p>
  <p>However, if the hole or weak spot is lower down the wall, or at the bottom of the wall, then this is going to be a more severe situation. You&#8217;ll want to drain the pool as soon as possible, and start putting together some items to begin fixing the wall. They do sell repair kits for walls on Amazon.</p>
  <p>You will have three ways to repair a damaged wall:</p>
  <p>Using sheet metal and duct tape to secure the damaged area. Just make sure you remove as much water from the pool as you can before starting repairs. This will protect you while you are working, and allow you to check your work while the pool fills back up with water.</p>
  <p>If you don&#8217;t mind spending a good amount of money, you can purchase an entirely new wall. This is by far the most expensive and time-consuming option, but many pool owners believe that this is the most secure way to keep their families safe while using the pool. In this case, you can purchase a new pool wall from most manufacturers, or you can find replacement pool walls here on Amazon.</p>
  <p>Finally, if you want to do it yourself, and you have a weak area in the lower part of the pool wall, where there is a lot of pressure from the water, you&#8217;ll want to read the next section to find out how to repair the wall yourself.</p>
  <h3>Repairing the wall</h3>
  <p>You&#8217;ll need a few things before starting to repair the wall:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>A piece of the pool wall that&#8217;s large enough to replace the piece of the wall with the hole</li>
  <li>Steel bolts</li>
  <li>A drill</li>
  <li>Duct tape</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can get the piece of pool wall from your pool manufacturer, or you can grab a piece of a used pool wall. No matter how you get it, you&#8217;ll want the piece to be the same height as your current pool wall, and you also want it to be at least a few feet wide.</p>
  <p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten the pool wall, it&#8217;s time to use steel bolts to fasten the wall in place. Simply place the new piece of wall up against the outside of the damaged wall, and use the bolts to fix it in place. After it&#8217;s in the right place, use the drill to make holes from the inside of the pool, and secure the bolts with the drill. Make sure the bolts are fastened tightly, since the pool wall will be responsible for holding in hundreds, of not thousands, of gallons of water.</p>
  <p>All you have to do now is to use duct tape to secure the screws and keep them from corroding over years of water exposure. After that, you just need to make sure the wall is secure and ready, and then start filling up the pool again. Just like the first time you filled the pool with water, you&#8217;ll want to stay around to make sure the wall is secure as the pool fills. It&#8217;s much easier to catch an error this early than when the pool is full of water.</p>
