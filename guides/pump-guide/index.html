  <h1>Above Ground Pool Pump Guide &amp; Reviews</h1>
  <h2>What is a pool pump</h2>
  <p>A pool pump is the most important piece in your filter system - it&#8217;s what keeps the water flowing and keeps your pool clean. A pool pump that&#8217;s not functioning correctly, or one that has stopped altogether, will quickly shut down your entire pool and make it uninhabitable.</p>
  <p>Some pools come with a solid pump and filter system, but many manufacturers include below average parts, either to cut costs or because they believe most owners will replace their pump with a better one in a few years. In some cases, pool manufacturers simply sell the frame, wall, and liner, and let the buyer purchase the pool pump that suits their needs the best.</p>
  <p>In any case, if you need to find a good pool pump, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. This article will teach you what to look for in a pool pump, what you should expect to pay, and we will also highlight a few of our favorite pumps for your consideration.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, most pool pumps last less than 5 years, which means finding a quality pool pump that will last the lifetime of the pool is difficult. The good news is that, with some basic maintenance and a little research, you can find the right size pump for your pool system and budget, and prolong the life of the pump to much more than 5 years.</p>
  <h2>Types of Pool Pumps</h2>
  <p>There are three major types of pool pumps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Single
    </li>
    <li>
      Two Speed
    </li>
    <li>
      Variable
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Single Pool Pumps</h3>
  <p>A single pool pump does exactly what the name implies - it keeps water flowing at a single rate. It won&#8217;t speed up to filter water quicker, but operates at a steady rate at all times. The power used by the pump will be the same across the board, and as the owner, you have one option - either turn the pump on or off.</p>
  <p>Single pool pumps may not sound that attractive, but they last a really long time, and have become and industry standard. Most pool packages come with a single speed pool pump, and many of these last for years.</p>
  <p>This type of pool pump is very effective, and if it&#8217;s on, it will be pumping your water very quickly. Circulation for this type of pump is very good, and they are often the cheapest option available. The reliability of these pumps is also incredible, even compared to more expensive pumps that have multiple speeds. They are also very easy to repair, and if you enjoy do it yourself activities, any issues that arise can be repaired efficiently and without much cost.</p>
  <p>However, because a single speed pump is always running at maximum speed, it&#8217;s not very efficient. The power consumption for this type of pool is larger that others, and they will also be much louder. Other parts of the filter system also tend to wear out faster because the pump is always running at such high speeds. You will need to monitor the pump and make sure it only comes on a few hours a day to get the best results.</p>
  <p>Some owners feel that a single speed pump feels like premium than other types, and that&#8217;s because it is - these pumps are meant to do their job well, and last a long time, and as long as you purchase a quality pump and do some light maintenance, it will last you for years.</p>
  <h3>Two Speed Pool Pumps</h3>
  <p>A two speed pump has two settings - a high speed (similar to the normal operating speed of a single pool pump) and a low speed. The low speed is an excellent option to continue running water, but give the filter system and your electricity bill a break. Low speeds will continue circulating the water and running the filter system, but at around half the cost of energy and much lower noise volume.</p>
  <p>The lower speed of a pump is perfect for continuous, or near continuous circulation of pool water. Remember, still water is a magnet for algae and other sorts of debris to contaminate the pool water, so having a pump that can run almost all the time is very useful. For the majority of the time (up to 80 percent), the pump will run in low speed, making less noise and requiring a smaller amount of electricity. In some instances it&#8217;s hard to tell the pump is even on, especially if there are kids having fun in the pool. This lends itself to a much higher quality feel for the pump.</p>
  <p>These pumps also have the ability to run on high speed, just like a single speed pump, and move a ton of water through the filter, but they will still generate a lot of noise and use more power. However, having the ability to switch between the two modes, and in some cases do this automatically based on the time of the day, means you don&#8217;t have to think about filtering your pool very often. A good two speed pump will take care of this for you.</p>
  <p>The biggest disadvantage with this type of pump is the higher starting costs. They often aren&#8217;t included with standard pool sets, since single speed pumps are much more efficient and will last longer. This is also older technology, so if you want to have the absolute best, a variable speed pump gives you the most options, and may even be cheaper than a traditional two speed pump.</p>
  <h3>Variable Speed Pumps</h3>
  <p>Variable speed pumps are the latest and greatest type of pump for above ground pools. They have the ability to adjust themselves to suit the exact speed needed at the time, and because of advances in technology, this type of pump isn&#8217;t nearly as expensive as it used to be.</p>
  <p>This type of pump will be much quieter in normal operation than other types, and the variable speed allows for the most power efficient pump available. Even when running at the same speed as a single speed pump, the Magnet Motors in variable speed pumps actually still uses less energy.</p>
  <p>Variable pumps will adjust to the exact speed you need for your pool to stay circulated and clean, which further increases the energy savings, as long as you&#8217;re willing to pay more upfront in comparison to a single speed pump. The pumps can be run at lower speed during the time when you and your family are using the pool, or at night, and this also makes them seem much quieter than other pumps. </p>
  <p>Single and dual speed pumps are engineered to run at set speeds, but this may be too much for your needs, or not enough. Variable pumps have the ability to run a little more than the low setting on a two speed pool pump, which means that if head pressure is keeping the low setting on your pool pump from circulating the water enough, you can bump up the speed a bit. While it doesn&#8217;t sound like it would make a huge difference, being able to tailor the speed of your pump to your individual needs is a huge advantage.</p>
  <p>Another major benefit is the durability. Because of the improvements in technology, many manufacturers claim that a variable speed pump will outlast other types by several years, at least. This can help offset the larger upfront costs of a variable pump. Because the variable speed pumps allow for more flexibility on lower settings, other equipment in your pool filter system will have a longer life as well, since slower pump speeds allow for better debris and algae management.</p>
  <p>The high price is still a factor though. Variable speed pumps are still more expensive than other types, with a starting price of around $500, up to over a thousand dollars. Some energy companies offer a price reduction for pools that use variable speed filters, but the cost will still likely be more than other pumps. </p>
  <p>However, if you are thinking about replacing a pump, or are purchasing a pump for your first above ground pool, then we&#8217;d highly recommend doing some research on variable pumps, as many owners believe they provide the best value for money in the long run.</p>
  <h3>Software for Variable Speed Pumps</h3>
  <p>Variable pumps can use software to dynamically adjust the speed of the filter system based on the time of day or the needs of the pool. This software is also capable of working in conjunction with other pool features, so if the water flow needs to be turned up or down to work with a heating system, it can respond dynamically. In this example, once the heater has brought the water temperature back up to its preset level, it will turn off, and the pump speed will return to its normal operating procedure and will again work to conserve as much energy as possible.</p>
  <p>This software in many variable speed pumps also has a technology that will prevent any blockage in the pump, or shut down if it senses debris in the filter system that may cause damage. This is a great feature, as it can give you some extra piece of mind that your pump is capable of protecting itself and preventing damage, to a certain extent.</p>
