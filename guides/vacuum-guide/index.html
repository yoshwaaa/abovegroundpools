  <h1>Above Ground Pool Vacuum Guide</h1>
  <p>Above ground pools are often thought of as more convenient than inground pools - they can easily be moved, require less maintenance in most situations, and are much more affordable. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean you can simply purchase an out of ground pool and forget about maintenance. In addition to keeping the pump running and making sure the chlorine levels are consistent, you will also have to clean debris and keep the floor of the pool free from algae.</p>
  <p>Many pool owners do a great job at cleaning up leaves and other debris from the surface of the pool water, since this stuff is easy to see. However, it&#8217;s equally important, maybe even more important, to consistently clean the floor of your pool, since this is a common area where algae can grow, and if the floor of the pool gets covered in bacteria, you will probably have to replace the entire liner.</p>
  <p>This is where a pool vacuum comes in. Many filter and pump systems come with a basic vacuum, which sucks in debris that&#8217;s circulating on the pools surface. But this isn&#8217;t enough for pool owners that want to maximize the life of their pools, or those that want to make sure they keep the pool as clean as possible for the safe enjoyment of their families.</p>
  <h2>Where Does A Pool Vacuum Fit In</h2>
  <p>Pool vacuums should be part of your initial purchase of your above ground pool. It&#8217;s that essential to maintaining the pool and drastically increasing the lifespan of your purchase. A cheaper vacuum should cost around $100, but more advanced options can be much more expensive - some even cost thousands of dollars. Many pool sets come with vacuum cleaners, but even if your purchase a pool that doesn&#8217;t, you should still factor in at least a basic pool cleaner with your initial purchase.</p>
  <p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten your pool up and running, you should be vacuuming your pool regularly. In case you haven&#8217;t vacuumed in a while, here are some signs that you should be on the lookout for:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Your pool water is starting to become cloudy or has taken on a different color. Pool water should be clean and clear, so if this isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re seeing, then you probably need to get your vacuum up and running as soon as possible. This can be a sign that the floor or walls have collected enough bacteria to start contaminating the water.</li>
  <li>Algae has started collecting on the floor or walls. In case you see some spots around the walls or the floor of the pool, or the bottom is especially slick, then you&#8217;ll want to get the vacuum out soon.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The pool vacuum is a vital part of your pool maintenance routine, but some owners are initially very intimidated about using the filter system correctly, or using the vacuum. This is why this guide was made - to help you understand how to use a pool vacuum, or if you haven&#8217;t purchased one yet, how to find the right vacuum for your budget and needs.</p>
  <h2>How to use a pool vacuum</h2>
  <p>Maintaining your above ground pool isn&#8217;t very difficult, it just takes a couple simple steps that you need to do regularly. Some steps, like running the pool pump, need to happen at least once a day. Others you only have to do once a week, or even less during certain seasons of the year. A pool vacuum can be used very often, or can be set aside for a few days. This isn&#8217;t something you need to worry about every day, unless your pump is having issues or a storm has just passed through your area.</p>
  <p>There are two types of pool vacuums:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Manual
    </li>
    <li>
      Automatic
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Manual pool vacuums</h3>
  <p>Manual vacuums have a head and a pole, with a hose attached to create suction and pull debris and algae off the wall and floor of your pool. After hooking up the pole and the vacuum head, and checking to make sure that it&#8217;s operating properly underwater (which means you place the head underwater and make sure it maneuvers properly), it&#8217;s time to attach the hose and place the head of the vacuum underneath the water again. This will allow water to fill into the hose, which creates suction and allows the vacuum to sink comfortably to the bottom of the pool.</p>
  <h2>Manual or automatic pool vacuums?</h2>
  <p>Between the two types of pool vacuums, you&#8217;ll want to choose one mostly depending on your budget. If you have the money to spend a little more (a lot more) on a great automatic vacuum, it&#8217;s likely you will never have to worry about algae or any debris collecting on the floor or wall of your pool. This allows you to enjoy your pool more, instead of spending time checking the pool for built up algae or vacuuming regularly.</p>
  <p>However, a manual pool vacuum has some major advantages too. First, they are much cheaper than most automatic vacuums, and this can be very important to first-time pool owners that want to purchase a vacuum but want to save some money upfront. Using a manual vacuum often results in a cleaner pool too, since it&#8217;s much easier for you to maneuver it around tight spots, like the pool ladder, than any machine can. While it may require some extra effort on your part, you will have a cleaner pool, as long as you remember to vacuum regularly.</p>
  <p>Again, what type of vacuum you choose mostly depends on your budget. If you are unsure, we&#8217;d suggest purchasing a manual vacuum, and seeing how you do with that. Most options won&#8217;t cost you much extra, and will help you keep your pool nice and clean. If you find that the pool is getting dirty and you don&#8217;t have the time to keep it clean, you can always purchase a more expensive automatic cleaner, and keep the manual vacuum for times where you really want to get the pool as clean as possible.</p>
  <h2>Some other things to consider</h2>
  <p>A great vacuum can make all the difference in keeping your pool clean, but there are some other items and practices you can do to help in fighting against debris and algae building up in the pool. Here are some additional things you can do when maintaining your pool:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Using a pool cover
    </li>
    <li>
      Chlorine tablets
    </li>
    <li>
      Pool shocking solution
    </li>
  </ul>
