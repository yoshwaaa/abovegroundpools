  <p>You&#8217;ve purchased an above ground pool, but maybe you want to add a few extra touches to make it yours. Or maybe you&#8217;ve owned a pool for several years, and want to purchase a few additions to help it seem new again. It&#8217;s also possible that your current pool has all the features you thought you wanted, but now you realize that you need something else, like a deck or a pool fence. If any of the above descriptions sounds like your situation, you&#8217;ve come to the right place. </p>
  <p>It&#8217;s our mission to help you decide what exactly you need, and help you get the best price possible. Feel free to browse to the category that interests you the most, and we&#8217;ll walk you through just about everything you can add to your above ground pool, from lights, to fountains, to toys.</p>
  <h2>Pool Decks</h2>
  <p>For many pool owners, a simple and sturdy pool ladder is enough to get in and out of the pool, especially for smaller above ground pools. However, for larger pools or for families that want to add some extra space to their pool, a pool deck can be a great investment.</p>
  <p>There are plenty of options for pool decks, and many pool owners decide to build a deck on their own, or have another party build a deck for them. There are some great options for those that don&#8217;t want to invest a ton of money into a pool deck though.</p>
  <p>Deck kits are readily available on Amazon, and while they aren&#8217;t exactly cheap, they are often much less expensive than having another company build a full deck for your above ground pool.</p>
  <p>If you need an especially large pool deck, we&#8217;d recommend building one yourself or having another company make a deck for you. However, most owners won&#8217;t likely need a large pool deck, and in this case, a pool kit from Amazon would probably be the most economical decision.</p>
  <h2>Automatic cleaners</h2>
  <p>An automatic pool cleaner is a great investment, especially for pool owners that don&#8217;t want to clean their pool every day. The tradeoff here is that an automatic pool cleaner won&#8217;t be as thorough as using a manual cleaner and are more expensive.</p>
  <p>What works for most buyers is using an automatic cleaner daily, and use a manual cleaner every once in a while, or after a major storm to make sure no debris of algae builds up.</p>
  <p>Depending on how much you want to spend, automatic pool cleaners can cost anywhere from $100&#8211;300. Intex creates some great pools, and their cleaner is actually one of the most affordable options out there.</p>
  <p>You could also try a Hayward product, as they have great reviews and are very affordably priced. They have thousands of reviews on Amazon, and have some great products.</p>
  <h2>Filters</h2>
  <p>Upgrading a filter, or replacing a malfunctioning one, is hopefully something most pool owners won&#8217;t have to do many times during the lifetime of their pool.</p>
  <p>Depending on how much you want to spend, there are tons of different types of filters available to you. If you need more information, check out our filter guide. A good filter will cost around $200, but can get much more expensive if you have a larger pool or more advanced needs.</p>
  <p>Rx has some very popular filters currently listed on Amazon, but Intex also makes a great product. Their filter pumps have garnered thousands of positive reviews, and are very affordably priced.</p>
  <h2>Ladders</h2>
  <p>While many pool kits come with a perfectly fine ladder, some owners prefer to buy a more sturdy product, or believe that the ladder that came with their pool isn&#8217;t high quality enough. A good ladder will last the lifetime of the pool, but it doesn&#8217;t mean purchasing a better ladder won&#8217;t be a good investment, since it&#8217;s the only way to get in and out of the pool, it&#8217;s important to get a good product.</p>
  <p>There are plenty of great products on Amazon.</p>
  <h2>Ladder mats</h2>
  <p>A ladder mat may not seem like much of an investment, but it can really help keep feet clean when entering and exiting the pool. This is especially useful for pools that are in a yard and surrounded by grass or dirt.</p>
  <p>For instance, when getting in the pool, tracking dirt on your feet consistently can make keeping the pool clean much more difficult. A mat can help you by simply giving you the space to wipe your feet.</p>
  <h2>Liners</h2>
  <p>Pool liners are an incredibly important part of your pool. If the liner gets damaged or needs to be replaced for any reason, you&#8217;ve got plenty of options open to you, no matter what type or size of pool you have.</p>
  <p>In some other cases, purchasing a pool liner doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be for repairs or maintenance - you can also purchase a pool liner just to spruce up the look of your pool. For instance, if you have a lighter pool liner, a darker one can go a long way in changing the look of your pool.</p>
  <p>Depending on how much you want to pay, you can get liners in a variety of sizes, colors, and thickness. Expect to pay at least $100 for a quality liner, but you can find some great deals on a liner on Amazon.</p>
  <h2>Pumps</h2>
  <p>Most pumps don&#8217;t need to be replaced for many, many years. But in case you do need to replace one for repairing your pool, or if you&#8217;d like to purchase one with more power, there are tons of options available to you on Amazon.</p>
  <p>A good quality pump will be around $100&#8211;200, but there are some great value options if you&#8217;d like something more affordable. You can check a few different options on Amazon, but we highly recommend Intex line of products, which you can learn more about here.</p>
  <h2>Skimmers</h2>
  <p>A skimmer is another essential piece of your above ground pool, but most pool kits will provide you with a solid quality skimmer system. This isn&#8217;t to be confused with a simple leaf skimmer, which comes with almost every pool.</p>
  <p>For skimmer systems, both Hayward and Intex make high-quality products that have garnered plenty of positive reviews on Amazon. They are usually very affordable, so if you aren&#8217;t happy with your current skimmer system, you can get a great deal on these products on Amazon.</p>
  <p>However, if you&#8217;re looking for a basic leaf skimmer, you can also find those on Amazon for just a few dollars.</p>
  <h2>Covers</h2>
  <p>Above ground pool covers are an essential part of just about pool, but many all in one kits don&#8217;t include a quality cover. This is unfortunate, since a pool cover can drastically increase the life of your pool, while also protecting the liner and preventing any damage during long periods where you won&#8217;t be using the pool (in the winter months, for instance).</p>
  <p>Thankfully, pool covers are very affordable. You can get them in a range of sizes and colors, and they will typically run you less than 50 dollars. For an essential item that will protect your pool and keep the water clean during periods of non-use, this is a great deal.</p>
  <h2>Reels</h2>
  <p>This may be hard to picture, but a reel is basically a device that sits on one side of your pool, and allows you to &#8220;wind out&#8221; a pool cover. This is a quick, easy way to move out a cover or a solar blanket.</p>
  <p>A reel has the same benefits as a cover and is much easier to use on a daily basis, but a reel is also more expensive. For many owners that want to use a cover every day, a reel will be a huge benefit.</p>
  <p>However, one of the important things to consider when a reel is if it&#8217;s too excessive for you or not. If you don&#8217;t imagine using a pool cover or solar blanket every day, it&#8217;s probably more economical to just purchase a cover and manually lay it over your pool whenever you need to.</p>
  <h2>Heaters</h2>
  <p>Many pool owners agree that adding a heating element to your above ground pool is a massive improvement, but can be quite expensive to add to your current system.</p>
  <p>There are things you can add to your pool that are affordable, but also capable of heating the water. A solar cover, for instance, will take the heat from the sun and will make the water warmer. You can also add in a heated mat to the floor of the pool, which can raise the temperature of the water efficiently.</p>
  <p>Probably the best way to heat up your pool&#8217;s water, and also the most expensive, is to add a heater to your pool&#8217;s filter system. There are some great options available that you can add to your current system, or you can purchase a brand new filter that will heat the water for you.</p>
  <h2>Paint</h2>
  <p>Pool paint is a great addition for users that want to improve the visual quality of their pool walls. For pool owners that have a pool wall that&#8217;s showing its age, or that want to simply refresh the outside of their pool, paint is a great option.</p>
  <p>Prices can vary, but pool paint is usually fairly priced. However, most other types of paint can work just fine. The big benefit of pool paint is that&#8217;s it has been specifically made to be used on a pool wall and get wet, and it will withstand a lot of water.</p>
  <h2>Toys</h2>
  <p>There are hundreds of choices when it comes to pool toys, and just about anything you could want is available. We can&#8217;t give you any specific reviews or ideas, but rest assured, whatever you want in a pool toy, you can probably get. Even if it hasn&#8217;t officially been labeled a pool toy, any waterproof toy will be just fine in a pool with limited exposure. However, chlorine can damage anything over time, so make sure to be careful about using certain toys and leaving them in the water.</p>
  <h2>Slides</h2>
  <p>If you want to add some extra fun to your pool, and have kids that would use it, adding a slide is a great idea. You can get anything from a simple, small slide geared towards younger children, to large slides that circle around before ending in your pool.</p>
  <p>Smaller slides, like some options provided by Intex, will set you back around $100, while larger slides can be much more expensive.</p>
  <h2>Chlorinators</h2>
  <p>There are two major options for adding chlorine to your pool. Most pool kits will come with a basic chlorine device that floats on the surface of your pool, and it&#8217;s a great option.</p>
  <p>The second choice is to purchase an in line automatic chlorinator, which have much more advanced functionality, but usually cost a bit more. The key difference here is that you don&#8217;t have to add in chlorine on your own. The system will actually monitor your water and add in chlorine to keep it stable, which is a great benefit.</p>
  <p>An automatic chlorinator will usually cost around 50&#8211;60 dollars. Hayward makes some great products, but you can find a selection of other items on Amazon.</p>
  <h2>Chemical Testing kits</h2>
  <p>Chemical testing kits are basic, and you&#8217;ll likely order one every once in a while to test your water and make sure it&#8217;s clean and ready to use after winter months, or after removing some debris from your pool to make sure it&#8217;s safe.</p>
  <h2>Fountains</h2>
  <p>Many pool owners may feel like a pool fountain is a little unnecessary and excessive, but it can actually add some nice visual flair to your pool, especially if it is the center piece of your backyard.</p>
  <p>You may also be surprised to learn that pool fountains are actually very affordable, usually coming in at around 30&#8211;40 dollars.</p>
  <h2>Lighting kits</h2>
  <p>Like fountains, an above ground pool lighting kit may seem like it&#8217;s not necessary, but for users that want to swim during evening hours, a kit like this is essential.</p>
  <p>You can get just about any color you&#8217;d like with a lighting kit, and they are priced very fairly. You can add lights to the pool water, or you can have lights that will hang around the outside of your pool. Either way, they are perfect for many late night swim sessions.</p>
  <h2>Fencing</h2>
  <p>Fences are a great investment for owners that want to keep their family safe while using the pool, or who want to preserve the lifespan of their pool rim and walls (climbing in a pool from the outside over a wall can severely damage your pool frame over time).</p>
  <p>Fencing is actually quite expensive, and you&#8217;ll likely pay well over $100 on a fence that runs around the entire pool. Some owners only add a fence to the front of their pool, which will add some nice visual flair for less money.</p>
  <h2>Foam kits</h2>
  <p>If you're looking for the ultimate way to protect your children, adding a foam kit is a good way to soften up the edges and the hard parts of your pool frame.</p>
  <p>Foam kits are relatively cheap, and you can add them where they are needed the most. The foam is very easy to add, and any kit will have thorough instructions for how to add foam and keep it from getting damaged by water.</p>
