  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This guide was intended for anyone that's interested in purchasing an above ground pool but has no clue where to start. In this guide, you will learn the steps to picking the right pool for your needs, including setting a budget and measuring the right size of your yard to determine what type of pool you should get. You will also get a primer on what type of extras you may want to pick up. These can range from necessary items, like cleaning supplies, to add ons like pool lights or heated pumps. Finally, you will learn how to properly maintain a pool, and things to look for when buying a pool to make sure you're getting a good deal and your pool will last many years.
  </p>
  <h2>Setting your budget</h2>
  <p>
    This is the most important step before purchasing a pool. You need to decide how much you're willing to spend on a pool, in total. It's easy to purchase something cheap, to save money up front, but this often means you'll end up with an inferior product that can break down easily. On the other hand, you may spend too much on a pool that has a bunch of options you don't actually need. Setting your budget will help you make the right decision and keep you from picking something that's going to underwhelm you in the long run.
  </p>
  <p>
    When determining how much you want to spend, keep in mind that you'll need to factor in cleaning supplies and any other additions that you may need. Here's the full list of things you want to take into considering when buying a pool:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The pool, which includes the liner, a wall, a pump, and a filter
    </li>
    <li>
      Cleaning supplies, like a skimmer and chlorine packets
    </li>
    <li>
      A way to get into the pool, either a ladder or a pool deck
    </li>
    <li>
      A pool cover (this will help you keep the water clean during storms, etc.)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It's really not that much, considering most pool kits will contain most of what you need to get started. In the case that you purchase a pool and get your own filter, pump, and liner separately, this guide will walk you through what you should get.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the core purchase, which will include at least the pool wall and a liner, you can spend as little as $100 to get something decent, but most likely a little small. However, in case you have very small children, or think you'll be just fine with a smaller pool, a cheaper pool will be all you need. Intex currently makes the best small pools in the business, so if this is something you're interested in, their whole lineup is very strong.
  </p>
  <p>
    A larger pool can cost over $1,000 and will likely last at least a decade, but in most cases, the more expensive pools will last much longer than this. However, this doesn't mean that you need to spend thousands of dollars to get a quality pool that lasts many years. If you do your research and purchase a pool from a good brand, and then keep up with maintenance and any minor repairs, you can have a pool that lasts many years for just about any price.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing to consider when it comes to price is portability. If you have a larger yard and want to purchase a pool that will stay in one spot and withstand all seasons, you are going to have to spend more money. If you don't mind purchasing a smaller pool that can fold up into storage easily, you can save some money by purchasing a portable pool. The downside is that to maximize the life of the pool, you will want to store it during winter months. Thankfully, most companies that make a portable pool have some features that will make storing the pool and setting it back up again much easier than a typical above ground pool setup.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best way to purchase a pool is to determine how much you're willing to spend, and subtract about 10% off of the price (reserved for extra addons and cleaning supplies), and then budget off that price.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will also want to make sure you have the cleaning supplies you need the moment you begin setting up your pool. It's good that this stuff isn't very expensive. You can make a few quick purchases on Amazon to get all the stuff you need to keep the pool safe and secure.
  </p>
  <h2>Picking the right size for your pool</h2>
  <p>The second step, once you've determined your budget, is to figure out what size pool you need. Most pool manufacturers will make the same product in several different sizes, so the pool size is mostly up to your preference. Here are the important things to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The size of your yard</li>
    <li>The amount of people that will be using the pool regularly</li>
    <li>If you'd like to have pool parties</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The size of your yard</h3>
  <p>
    This may not seem like such a big deal, but since a pool will likely be there for years to come, it's important that it goes well with your yard and doesn't take up too much space. If you have a smaller backyard, something that doesn't take up too much space is essential. In a situation like that, it's good to purchase a portable pool, since you can easily drain and remove it from your backyard for certain events or gatherings if you need to. Most portable pools are also smaller, so they won't take up too much space.
  </p>
  <h3>The amount of people using the pool</h3>
  <p>If you are getting a pool for several children, or a larger family, then size will be very important. However, you may have a choice between shallow or deep pools, which means that if you have very small children, it may be a good idea to get a small pool. Most pools will be around 4-5 feet deep, but some other pools come in smaller sizes.</p>
  <p>However, even if you have smaller children now, it still may be a good idea to get a taller pool that your kids will grow into. It's also important to mention that getting a pool that's too small can be difficult to deal with, but larger pools won't seem like a mistake. In many cases, large pools are easy to grow accustomed to.</p>
  <h3>Pool parties</h3>
  <p>
    This may seem like no brainer, but if you want to have pool parties, you are going to need a larger pool. If you plan on having lots of pool parties, either for kids or adults, you're going to want to get the largest pool you can fit in your yard or the biggest one that still fits within your budget. In many cases, a pool that's made for pool parties goes best with a pool deck. Many pool owners will want to build the pool deck themselves, which is a great idea and can be a good way to save money. However, some others may want to hire help or purchase a pre built pool deck.
  </p>
  <h2>All in one pool package or separate pieces</h2>
  <p>After you've set your budget, and you've determined the size of the pool you'd want (it's okay if you decide that you're flexible when it comes to pool size, just know that getting something a little bigger is okay, but purchasing a pool that's a little too small for your needs can be tough to live with), it's time to decide if you want an all in one package or would prefer to pick all the separate pieces yourself.</p>
  <p>Most beginner packages will come with everything you need in the box. You'll get a pool and liner that fit together, a pump that's usually got just enough power to consistently clean and filter the amount of water in your pool, a ladder, and even some extras like a surface skimmer or a cover. This can also be a great option for any buyer, not just a first-time above ground pool purchase. If you have a smaller pool and want to upgrade to a bigger one, chances are most of your current equipment won't work with the larger pool anyway, so all in one packages are always a great option.</p>
  <p>The major downside here is that you're pretty much stuck with the equipment you get in the box, and will have to pay extra to change something like the pool ladder (and you'll also have to get rid of the original ladder that came with the set). It's not the most economical choice to purchase replacements for parts you've already gotten in a package, so here's a good rule of thumb when buying a pool this way - set up everything you get in the box, and give it at least 3 months. If you purchase a pool set and find that you'd like a more powerful pump, or a larger ladder, then you can always purchase a new one later. By giving the original equipment at least a test run, you'll find that your family will be happy with what they have, and if something in the package isn't quite to your liking, you can swap it out after at least 3 months.</p>
  <p>For the most part, pool packages provide great value and the included equipment is usually high quality, but some pool owners find themselves upgrading the pump or filter for ones with added features, like better skimming options or pumps that heat the water (especially good for buyers that live in colder climates). If you've done some research, and believe that piecing together the parts for a pool would be a more responsible decision in the long run, then you've also got plenty of options.</p>
  <p>The biggest benefit to assembling the pool parts yourself is choice. You will get to choose exactly what size and shape of pool you want, the color and quality of the liner, and the power and features of the pump/filter system. This is a great option for buyers that are trying to build a pool to last them several decades, and are willing to do some more research up front. For these buyers, the main components of every above ground pool include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The walls and frame (these parts should always come together)</li>
    <li>The liner (you can purchase a liner from just about any major pool manufacturer)</li>
    <li>The pump (again, you have plenty of choices here, but it's always better to get something a little overpowered than to get something that won't quite move enough water)</li>
    <li>A way to get in and out of the pool (a standard pool ladder will work in almost any situation)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, you'll want to get a chlorine kit to keep the pool water clean, and you'll also want to purchase a pool cover to protect the pool from debris and algae during storms or colder months.</p>
  <p>The major downside the purchasing all the separate pieces is that you're going to have to do more research up front, and make decisions about parts that you may have never had any experience with before. This means that you need to spend some time thinking about your budget and needs before you even start to research. Yes, a powerful pump with water heating features is great, but is it going to require more maintenance and electricity from you in the long run, and is it something your family is even going to use?</p>
  <p>You'll also likely spend more money piecing together the parts yourself, since separate pool pieces are usually targeted towards owners that know exactly what they want. The good part is that when you buy something on its own, you can check reviews to make sure that you're getting a top quality product.</p>
  <p>No matter which type of methodology you prefer - buying an all in one package or purchasing all the pieces by themselves - by setting your budget beforehand and taking some time to research/think about your family's needs, you will have the insight you need to make the best financial and practical decision when purchasing an above ground pool. Just remember that you can always upgrade a cheaper piece of equipment, so it may be safer to start with a more affordable option and purchase something nicer down the road.</p>
  <h2>Buying the pool</h2>
  <p>So now you've made your decision on budget and size, and you've determined if you want to buy a package or piece everything together yourself. It's time to actually buy the pool! So where do you start? Well, first you should do some quick research to determine what type of pool shops are close to you. It's also a good idea to read some reviews online (we have plenty of reviews here, but you can also read customer reviews for many pool products on Amazon.com).</p>
  <p>It may be a good idea to go into a pool store to check out any potential pools that you're considering, but be warned - many pool stores will charge a premium on pools that you purchase from them, and some buyers may feel pressured to purchase the pool that the seller is trying to get them to purchase. If you're worried about this, it may be a good idea to purchase a pool online and have it shipped to your house. This can be beneficial in a few ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It will save you money. Purchasing directly from an online dealer or from a large company like Amazon will help you cut costs - there will be no dealer markup fees, so you'll probably get the lowest price, especially if you get free shipping from somewhere like Amazon.</li>
    <li>You won't be pressured. A pool shop will often make more money on certain products, and they can pressure potential customers into buying those products, but you won't have to deal with that when purchasing from an online retailer. You can read as many reviews on the product as you'd like, and make the purchase only when you feel ready, not because you're being pressured by a dealer.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>One big benefit to a pool shop is that they will have the products in the store, so you can view a pool and make sure it's the right size. This is a great option, and if you're comfortable going into a pool shop and "just looking around" this can be a good way to check out different pool sizes and manufacturers to see what you like.</p>
  <p>Once you've determined the size of pool you want, it's also a good idea to measure the size out in your yard. Even when viewing a pool in a shop, it's easy to get distorted, since things will often a certain way in a store, but then appear totally different when set up in your yard. By measuring the pool diameter before you make a purchase, you can be sure that the size of pool you're looking at is the right size for your yard and needs.</p>
  <p>It's also important to note that pool manufacturers do make a difference. A trusted brand like Intex makes many high-quality products, and are pretty well known in the above ground pool market, so it's hard to go wrong with any pool they make. However, if you are going with a lesser known pool company, you may want to do some extra research on the quality and durability of their products, since you'll want to make your pool last as long as possible. Some light research on pool brands is also a great way to make a decision between similar products - if you have two or three different pools you are considering, and one is made by a better brand, our choice would be to go for the one with the best brand reputation.</p>
  <h2>Buying the extras</h2>
  <p>Once you've picked out the right pool, it's time to start thinking about the extras. The most important thing to remember when it comes to addons is that there is no time limit. If you'd like to purchase a nicer pool cover than the one that came with your pool, you have plenty of time to decide what type of product you want and how much you're willing to spend. However, there are some necessary add ons that should be purchased as soon as possible. These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pool covers</li>
    <li>Pool ladders (although most pools will come with ladder, some manufacturers may not include one)</li>
    <li>Chlorine kits</li>
    <li>Vacuums and skimmers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Pool covers are necessary for just about any environment. If you live in a place where it storms even occasionally, a pool cover can be life saver. It will keep debris from falling into your pool during storms, or even if you plan to not use or clean the pool for a week or two. Debris can carry algae and dilute your pool water, which makes maintenance much more difficult. Many pool packages will come with a basic pool cover, but in case you don't have one, this should be an immediate purchase. Covers are also very helpful for winter months, since most families won't find much use for the pool during cold weather. However, if you live in an area that gets especially cold, it's a good idea to drain your pool during the winter to improve the lifespan of your pump and liner.</p>
  <p>Pool ladders almost always come with the pool, but on the off chance that your particular package didn't include one, this is obviously a necessary item. You'll need some way to get in and out of the pool, so a ladder is the most common choice. However, some companies make alternatives that are easy to use and get in an out of. Pool decks are another popular option that many owners feel adds to the visual quality of the pool, while improving the atmosphere for pool parties and other events that can take place around the pool.</p>
  <p>Chlorine kits are another common item that every pool owner needs, but it may not come with your package. Thankfully, this is an affordable add on, and it mostly contains the floating mechanism, which will always be floating around the surface of your pool, and the chlorine tablets. Some other items that may come with a basic chlorine kit include the testing items, which will tell you how much chlorine is in the water and if there's anything else you need to do to keep your pool water clean. These are all very affordable, and you can find them on Amazon.</p>
  <p>Finally, vacuums and skimmers are another necessary part of pool maintenance, but most pool owners skip these items during their initial purchase, which is a big mistake. The more you clean your pool, the longer it will last you. It's as simple as that. Pool skimmers are often included in pool packages, but in case you don't have one, there are several popular and affordable skimmers on Amazon.</p>
  <p>Vacuums are another important piece of maintenance, and while they can be quite expensive, there are plenty of budget options. To get an in depth look at vacuums, including our picks for the best options, check out our pool vacuum guide.</p>
  <p>There are also some great additions for every pool that aren't necessary, but can add plenty of unique features. If this is something you're interested in, check out our <a href="/guides/accessories/">Above Ground Pool Accessories Guide</a>.</p>
  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <p>Now that you have a pool and all the necessary additions, it's time to begin work on setting up your backyard. Contrary to popular belief, the most important step in setting the pool up actual comes before installing any piece of the frame or wall - it's prepping the ground where the pool will sit. This is broken down into a few steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Measuring the ground</li>
    <li>Removing any rocks or debris from the measured out spot</li>
    <li>Flattening the surface as much as possible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you haven't already measured the spot where you're going to set up the pool, that's the first step. Think of it as a blueprint to where you're pool is going and how it will look before you even start the manual labor of installing the pool. The best part is that at this stage, you can easily adjust where you'd like your pool to be without the hassle of moving the entire frame or pool walls. Take the time to measure our your pool's exact diameter, and then figure out where it will go in your yard, based on how easily the ground can be cleared a flattened, and what looks the most natural to your eyes in your yard. It's a good idea to not place the pool too close to your house, since draining water from the pool can be dangerous if it's too close to your house.</p>
  <p>After you've figured out the spot and measured the diameter of your pool, it's time to clear the ground of any debris. Take your time and eliminate any rocks, lumps of grass, or anything that could potential poke a hole through the bottom of your pool liner. This is essential in securing your pool during setup, and will ensure that you are getting the absolute most out of your pools lifespan.</p>
  <p>Finally, it's time to flatten the ground where the pool will sit. This is the single most important step in setting up a pool, and it's the one that most pool owners skip over. Any bumps or dips in the ground can create pressure points in the pool liner, and over time this will create tears or loose spots in the bottom of your pool. This will greatly reduce the lifespan of your liner, and may even impact your pool's stability over years of abuse. Spend as much time as you can making sure the ground is as flat as possible, and don't be afraid to spend an entire afternoon prepping for your pool. If you've ordered one online, it's a good idea to prepare the ground the day before you get your pool, so you can ensure that you're putting as much time towards it as possible and not rushing to get the pool set up.</p>
  <p>Once you have the pool, it's time to set up the frame and pool walls. This is the most intimidating step for most pool owners, but it's actually a relatively simple process. Any pool system will come with thorough instructions on how to set up the wall and frame properly, and for the most part it will consist of securing screws, nuts and bolts in place and moving on to the next part of the frame. The pool wall is done in a similar fashion.</p>
  <p>However, we would highly recommend setting up the wall and frame with somebody else. This is a big job for a single person, so a family member or friend's help will be very useful. While some manufacturers have a streamlined process for the wall and frame, expect this step to take an entire afternoon or evening, even with the help of someone else. Just make sure you've tightened everything properly, and the pool wall is securely in place before you start the next step.</p>
  <p>Once the wall and frame are set up, it's time to lay the lining and connect the pump. The lining is another step that most pool owners get easily confused about, but it's rather simple. You'll want to stretch the lining out over the bottom of the pool and over the pool walls, and give it time to expand to fit snuggly over the outer rim of the wall. This can take time, and we'd recommend spending an entire afternoon or evening on this step alone, just to make sure the liner is securely fitted to the wall, but also that there are no bumps in the floor, which is a common mistake most first time pool owners make. Before you begin connecting the pump or filling the pool with water, walk the floor and make sure there is no excess liner material bunched up at the bottom of the pool, and if there is, simply stretch it out until it falls flat on the floor.</p>
  <p>Connecting the pool pump and filling the pool with water is the final step, and it's relatively straightforward. Any pump will come with a manual, which will walk you through how to power and operate the pump, and adding water is as simple as dragging a hose over to the pool and turning it on.</p>
  <p>However, we'd recommend staying by the pool as much as you can while it fills with water, since any leaks or weak spots in the liner or frame will be easy to spot at this point. It's much easier to fix a problem when the pool has just started to fill with water, as opposed to when it's full of hundreds, or even thousands, of gallons of water.</p>
  <h2>Maintenance and repair</h2>
  <p>Like any pool, you're going to have to begin performing maintenance the first day you start using the pool. This is why items like a pool vacuum and chlorine kit are so necessary - by getting into the habit of basic pool maintenance early on, you can reduce the chances of any major repairs down the road. Basic maintenance tasks include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Checking the water frequently to make sure the chlorine levels are stable</li>
    <li>Running the pool pump at least once daily (the pump should be run at least 8 hours every day)</li>
    <li>Removing any debris from the filter skimmer every day</li>
    <li>Use a handheld skimmer to remove any major debris from either the pool surface or the floor of the pool frequently</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you've got the basics covered, you should be good to go for many years to come, unless you notice a tear in the lining or some other damage to the pool wall.
